hey , hey , not so fast .
you know the drill .
you know what , pipsqueak ?
while you &apos;re stuck here in this rat hole , i &apos;m going to the lake .
wife &apos;s gonna pack a lunch , fill up a cooler .
bet you &apos;d enjoy that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
later , pipsqueak .
lights out .
hey , you want me to jam that thing where the sun don &apos;t shine ?
turn it off .
you know , i &apos;m getting real sick and tired of having to tell you the same thing twice , half pint .
maybe i ought to pay a little visit to that sweet thing you left on the outside .
how old was she when you robbed that cradle ?
yeah . attaboy .
get lost .
lights out !
where is it ?
where did you put my light ?
be glad you &apos;re not wearing it , half pint .
so , how &apos;s it feel to be in love ?
those big gulps go right through me .
you ready , pipsqueak ?
oh , what is your deal ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought .
plug that thing in .
come on , move it , pipsqueak .
who are you ?
i &apos;m coming for you , baby .
what &apos;s his problem ?
dude &apos;s in heat over julianne .
wrong , bitches .
men don &apos;t go into heat .
being the superior progenitors , they are always ready , willing , and able .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;about to ask advice from a gangbanger and a huntress .
never mind .
he actually chose not to speak .
this could be a good one . come on , let &apos;s hear it , lloyd .
you &apos;re just gonna stick me with the shame shank .
all right .
i have studied mating rituals , courtship customs , pondered the great poets .
maybe even deliberated gonadal growth in mammals .
but when it comes to women and doing my own thang , you know , i &apos;m lost .
hey , first of all , never say that again , never .
yeah , i second that .
do you need romance tips , lloyd ?
what women want is ...
all right , don &apos;t ... don &apos;t listen to her .
see , women do not know what they want , and even if they did , they would never admit that what they want is what they want .
that made absolutely zero sense .
no , i understood completely .
continue , shea .
i want to give you the shea daniels , patented , foolproof formula on how to make little bluebirds twirl around julianne &apos;s head .
all right . okay , look , lloyd , no .
you &apos;re benched .
i &apos;m listening to shea .
here we go .
fire and ice .
now you &apos;ve already done the fire part .
you &apos;ve given her non-stop attention for , like , a year .
so now it &apos;s time for the ... ?
oh , the ice .
the ice , that &apos;s right .
so when we get into the bullpen , and you see julianne ? promptly ignore her ass .
don &apos;t listen to her .
and ice .
that &apos;s right .
thank you , shea .
you &apos;ve got company .
brad kelley .
he kind of invited himself in .
all right .
thanks , jules .
nice boots .
i &apos;m not sure if i like &apos; em .
i &apos;m not sure i like &apos; em on my desk .
hey . how you been ?
good , good . good to see you .
yeah , you , too .
how &apos;s janet ?
suing me for spousal support .
thanks for reminding me .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
aah , screw her .
how you been ?
been busy .
got your badge back .
your own task force .
you know , i remember you pitched me the idea for this thing five years ago .
bring in cons to catch cons .
look at you now .
so , what brings you , brad ?
i &apos;m a bounty hunter now ; i got my bounty hunter &apos;s license .
yeah , i know , i know .
we used to mock the shit out of them .
i love it .
the money &apos;s really good , and i don &apos;t have all the suits mooning me at the time .
so , is that why you &apos;re here ?
yeah , i understand you got assigned some punk that , uh , broke out of five points .
that &apos;s right .
the prison &apos;s put up a ten grand reward .
figured , you know , maybe we could , uh , scratch each other &apos;s backs .
share a little information , develop some leads .
i &apos;ve still got a lot of contacts in law enforcement .
i can bring a lot to the table , ray .
bulldog brad , howling and growling .
nothing &apos;s changed , burner .
what do you say ?
i got a team to consider .
you know , they get a month off for every runner they catch .
all right .
okay , so , we work it a little .
you know , you say i was instrumental to where i get the reward , and i say you guys were as equally involved , and your cons get their month .
no one &apos;s the wiser .
brad , everything i do has to be above the board .
all right . well , there &apos;s my answer i guess , huh ?
you want me to crawl out the window so i don &apos;t ... ?
oh , come on .
it ain &apos;t like that .
you know that .
come on , what do you say , huh ?
for old time &apos;s sake .
all right , let me see what i can do .
good morning , lloyd .
we &apos;ll see you .
thanks , ray .
appreciate it . yup .
you &apos;re not gonna introduce us to your friend ?
no . go ahead , jules .
six years ago , rodney cain was dating lorraine hamilton .
she was 16 , he was 18 .
apparently , lorraine &apos;s stepfather was determined to end their relationship , even threatening to have rodney arrested for what was technically statutory rape .
the stepfather wound up bludgeoned to death .
all right , rodney served five years on a life sentence .
this morning , he electrocuted and beat a guard and left the other guard in a coma .
dude &apos;s five-six , 120 . that &apos;s one feisty white boy .
i have alerts on the guards &apos; credit cards , as well as an apb on the stolen camaro .
most important , according to coworkers , the guard kept a .45 smith &amp; wesson in the camaro .
rodney is armed and dangerous .
as opposed to armed and garrulous .
george carlin routine over .
he was the best .
oh , my god , look ... mm .
all right , campus officials at brenell college are trying to locate the ex-girlfriend , so our first stop is her mother &apos;s house .
oh , my god .
rodney seemed nice enough , but i always had to run interference whenever he came over .
he and my late husband hated each other .
i never thought it would end with one of them being murdered , but ...
why haven &apos;t you heard anything yet ?
well , campus police haven &apos;t been able to locate her .
but one of my team &apos;s is trying to get answers now .
i have a daughter i don &apos;t get to see often .
i can imagine hoyou must be feeling .
she &apos;s my whole world .
if anything happened to her ...
did , uh ... did rodney ever try to contact you from prison ?
no . i haven &apos;t seen or talked to him since he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs , and i &apos;d like to keep it that way .
all right , ma &apos;am , we &apos;d like to put a patrol car outside in case rodney decides to come back .
and we need to tap your phone in case he calls .
just please , find my daughter .
check it out .
campus police said a witness saw lorraine get into a gray camaro .
get in or getting pulled in ?
they didn &apos;t see what went down .
witness was a block away .
this woman is a massive narcissist and / or a liar .
now , candice claims that her daughter is her world , but of the 15 framed photos i saw in there , none of them are of lorraine ; plenty of candice , though-- all in her 20s .
now , the signs of aging infuriates narcissists .
they envy the young , and they want to avoid them or denigrate them whenever possible .
that &apos;s cougars in general , right ?
as far as i know .
all right , well , that &apos;s not enough to lean on her yet .
let &apos;s see what we can get off the camaro .
aren &apos;t you glad to see me ?
you don &apos;t act like it .
it &apos;s been five years ; you &apos;re not even supposed to be out .
all right ?
this is wrong .
but ... the letters .
you said you still love me .
what letters ?
do not say word .
okay , come on , kiddo , right over there .
these letters , lorraine .
why &apos;d you even bother ?
rodney , i didn &apos;t .
look at them .
look at them .
rodney , listen to me .
i didn &apos;t write these letters .
rodney ... get away from me .
stay here , please .
excuse me .
is everything okay over here ?
hey , mind your own business , pal .
are you okay ?
maybe you should come over here with us until he calms down a little bit .
what are you doing ?
what ... ?
what ... ?
what are you doing ?
kids , get over here .
get down on your knees .
rodney , stop !
tell me what you want , and i &apos;ll do it !
just tell me what you want ; i &apos;ll do anything that you want .
in my face . we were arguing , and ... he stuck a gun in my face .
i don &apos;t know .
well , lorraine begged rodney to spare the guy &apos;s life .
rodney listened to her .
the guy couldn &apos;t tell if
lorraine was with rodney willingly-- she got in the car with him to leave , but he did have a gun .
from lorraine , addressed to rodney at five points .
they &apos;re all love letters-- important enough for rodney to bring when he breaks out of prison but then he just chucks them in the trash .
what do you got , jules ?
checked the visitor log at five points .
candice hamilton visited rodney cain six times in the last five years .
didn &apos;t she say ... haven &apos;t heard from rodney since he was led out of the courthouse in cuffs .
all right , jules , bring candice in .
let her know i want to talk to her about some new leads .
hey , ray .
your buddy &apos;s here .
all right , wait here .
there &apos;s something up with this dude .
look at these uninhibited outpourings of love .
why can &apos;t i write to julianne like that ?
a chick wrote that .
that &apos;s a good point .
get your head back in the game , man .
anything from the witness ?
i thought we had a deal .
yeah , but i &apos;m not looking for a handout , okay ?
i earn my keep .
brad , just stay home-- call me with any tips you got .
in exchange , i &apos;ll give you that c.i. money .
come on , what is that , a grand ?
that barely fills my gas tank .
on this caper , and then on the next one , more , and then the one after that .
as long as you stay home and you call me with tips .
brad , we shook on this .
all right , all right .
hey , ray .
blue eyes there .
you tap that yet ?
go home , brad .
he a bounty hunter ?
i know all about the little sweetheart deals bounty hunters make with law enforcement , ray .
what &apos;s yours with him ?
we work our asses off to catch this guy , and at the last minute you slip him the collar and split the reward money ?
get in the truck .
we &apos;re not moving until we get a straight answer about your friend that you &apos;re helping steal our runner .
so you &apos;re not moving , huh ?
no , and neither is shea or lloyd .
okay , he was my mentor when i first joined the marshals .
and the only deal i made with him is confidential informant money in exchange for tips .
your months off are still protected as long as you catch this runner .
why couldn &apos;t he just call you ?
why &apos;d he have to drive down here and see you in person ?
i &apos;m saying this in a non-confrontational way .
well , he wasn &apos;t supposed to .
and he won &apos;t anymore .
so , let &apos;s get this straight , ray .
your buddy , who doesn &apos;t listen to you and who is no longer with the marshals because of what , he got booted , is now a bounty hunter and a bottom feeder at that , judging from his 20-year-old rig , and we &apos;re supposed to trust him ?
i &apos;m gonna get in the truck .
whoever stays out here will be considered a fugitive .
you guys want to ... ?
should we ... ?
candice here ?
in the interview room .
she signed her waiver , giving us permission to tap her home and cell phone .
hold on , hold on , hold on , hold on .
have you seen this , ray ?
look at this .
same writing .
that crazy bitch in there wrote these letters .
oh , my goodness !
lorraine must &apos;ve pointed that out to rodney , and that &apos;s why he freaked out and tossed them .
why would she do that ?
because she &apos;s ...
ray , can i have a crack at this harridan in there , please ?
what the hell &apos;s a harridan ?
it &apos;s a vicious woman , okay ?
it &apos;s an older woman .
it &apos;s her .
it &apos;s candice .
can i talk to her ?
all right , go .
slap a transmitter on candice &apos;s car so we can track her when she leaves .
so , we have some talking to do , candice .
we have ... a lot of talking to do .
any update on lorraine ?
none since they were seen at the park .
that bastard lays a finger on her ...
look , candice , uh , the visitation records indicate that you actually did visit rodney in prison .
you &apos;re right .
and i-i know that i told you at my house that i hadn &apos;t seen him , but i was so worked up , i completely forgot-- and i was going to tell you the next time i saw you .
you forgot six visits ?
that &apos;s ... very forgetful .
why did you visit him ?
to gauge his level of anger .
towards you ? and lorraine .
and it took you six visits to gauge that anger ?
who knew if he &apos;d get out ?
or if he &apos;d have one of his prison buddies come pay us a visit ?
clearly , i had reason to be concerned .
okay . let &apos;s set that aside .
did you write those ?
yes . mm-hmm . do you know what the next question &apos;s gonna be ?
i &apos;m sorry , this is so embarrassing .
no , we understand that .
but it &apos;s important for you to answer that question .
on my first visit to rodney , he asked me why lorraine hadn &apos;t written him .
and then i talked to lorraine about it , and she said she was never gonna write him , that she needed to move on .
i got nervous that that would set him off , so ...
i wrote a letter , acting as lorraine .
can you appreciate how someone might find this to ... be ...
but until that person who is going to judge me walks in and sees their spouse &apos;s brains splattered all over the floor ...
i was afraid and i was traumatized , and i made a decision based on that fear a trauma .
and i &apos;m sorry , but regardless of what you think of me , it &apos;s not helping to find my daughter right now .
no , it is helping us ascertain why rodney broke out of prison and-and-and for whom .
speaking of ...
did you have romantic feelings for rodney ?
a little bit ?
go ahead , answer it .
make sure you put it on speaker .
lorraine &apos;s fine .
now , listen to what i say .
get $ 50,000 and meet me in two hours at the storytown mall .
parking section 57 .
do not bring the police .
did you ever think about me ?
of course .
why didn &apos;t you write me ?
&apos;cause you told me that you didn &apos;t want to hear from me .
that it &apos;d make being in jail that much harder .
i would never say that .
i-i loved you .
what the hell did i do to your mom ?
you killed her husband , rodney .
and i-i beat two guards half to death to get out and be with you , based on the letters that she wrote me !
so that &apos;s on her !
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m ...
there ain &apos;t shit i can do about it .
i just need that money ... so i can disappear .
candice , test one , two , one , two .
yes , hello , i hear you .
okay , that &apos;s good .
just use your normal voice .
try not to fidget with the earpiece or the transmitter that &apos;s in your pocket , okay ?
we do not want rodney suspecting you &apos;re being monitored .
it &apos;s all dummy cash .
so he should buy it at first glance .
there &apos;s a track-and-trace receiver sewn into the lining .
there &apos;s a helicopter on its way , a half a dozen cop cars ready to move in on my call .
i &apos;ll be in constant communication with everyone , including you .
you &apos;re gonna do fine-- just ... breathe .
&quot; i miss your touch as well . &quot;
see , candice wrote that .
the woman is certifiably cuckoo bananas .
she doesn &apos;t have a body on her belt , lowery .
as long as she helps us find the guy that does ,
i don &apos;t care if she walks around covered in peanut butter .
all right , candice , position one .
cande , can you hear me ?
yes , i hear you .
okay , just sit tight until i give you your signal .
all right , all units on tack two , stay out of the perimeter until i give the word .
why did kelley get bounced from the marshals ?
look , if he &apos;s gonna be working with this team , we deserve to know his story .
i mean , all of our pasts are out on full display , and i &apos;m sure he knows them , too .
he took money .
was he there when you got popped ?
then why &apos;d you get your badge back ande didn &apos;t ?
it wasn &apos;t his first time .
the marshals had been building a case against him for a while .
had him on ten different charges .
then why are win business with this fool ?
you heard the expression ,
&quot; keep your friends close .
keep your enemies closer &quot; ?
i &apos;d rather have him home collecting informant money than out here competing with us .
he talked you into taking that money back , then , didn &apos;t he ?
bring you the fold so he didn &apos;t have to worry about you flipping on him ?
wait , how did he avoid jail time when they had multiple charges on him ?
i don &apos;t know , shea i &apos;m not a lawyer .
because he rolled on you .
wow , jackpot .
you called it .
i think , rather nobly , sweet raymond here has chosen to focus on his own culpability rather than ...
all right , everybody just shut up .
there he is ; let &apos;s just take his ass .
he &apos;s go a hostage , shea .
all right , candice , you &apos;re on .
just take it easy .
we &apos;ll be right here .
i &apos;m getting out of the car .
okay , that &apos;s good , but you don &apos;t have to tell me over the radio ;
i can see you .
i &apos;m walking towards him .
all right , take it easy , and just do what we discussed .
can you hear me ?
i told you guys she was cuckoo bananas .
can you hear me ?
is this thing working ?
- no , no , no .
don &apos;t take it out of your pocket .
- hello ?
all right , all units , go , go .
who the hell &apos;s this ?
back your car out of the way !
what are you doing , brad ?
chasing a runner .
get out of the way !
- you are a civilian .
- back it up !
you are interfering with a law enforcement investigation .
i got just as much a right to track this guy down as you do .
i &apos;ve got a license , you know .
- you clown !
- shut your mouth .
the guard in the coma at five points just went out of the picture .
reward went up 40 grand .
i need this money , ray .
keep your enemies close , huh ?
is this close enough for you ?
any progress from the locals on that camaro ?
none yet .
it looked like to us like you intentionally botched that ransom .
i might not have done what you asked , but that &apos;s because i couldn &apos;t hear .
nobody said to wave the walkie-talkie like a pom-pom , lady .
i have a theory , and it &apos;s that those letters actually contained your true emotions , and you don &apos;t want your daughter to live , because you &apos;re jealous of her youth and her beauty , and you want rodney for yourself .
you are out of your mind .
i &apos;m out of my mind ?
i have been studying massively messed up people since i had zits , and you are easily top five .
am i under arrest ?
we just want a straight answer .
yes or no ?
then i &apos;m leaving .
i &apos;ll contact the fbi to find my daughter , and if you continue to harass me ,
i &apos;ll contact my attorney .
what else could go wrong ?
why &apos;d you kill him ?
because ... i found out what happened .
it &apos;s okay .
he deserved to die .
what did he do ?
the abuse .
what abuse ?
um , him ... him raping you .
he never raped me .
your mother told me your stepfather molested you almost every night .
she said she wanted to help , but he threatened to kill you both .
and she said you threatened to kill yourself if anyone found out .
that &apos;s why i never said anything in court .
that &apos;s why i never said any ...
i never said anything to you .
hey , jules any movement on candice &apos;s car ?
she &apos;s pulled into a mini mall in west milford , new jersey , and looks like she &apos;s disconnected her cell phone , so no trace on that .
maybe candice has an electra complex for rodney .
i don &apos;t want to hear about candice , all right ?
i want to hear about lorraine , and don &apos;t tell me she couldn &apos;t have bailed on rodney if she wanted to .
we have to start looking at her as a willing participant in all this .
candice is still in play in this thing .
and my argument , which you interrupted , would lend further support to the notion that candice has feelings for rodney .
based on what ?
the electric company , or whatever the hell you just said ?
would it be more clear if i put it in terms of the father figure that just betrayed you , brad kelley ?
watch yourself .
relationships are complex , ray .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
or it &apos;s just all about money .
when the stepfather died , candice cashed in a million-dollar insurance policy .
she was only married for three years .
if they &apos;d gotten a divorce , she would have got a fraction of that .
she hired rodney to kill her husband .
that would explain the letters .
she was trying to keep rodney happy in prison .
&apos;cause when you do a crime and the person you did it for on the outside stops writing , that &apos;s when you start talking .
what &apos;s in it for rodney-- 25 years ?
maybe it went bad .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to get caught .
maybe he was set up .
why not bring that up in court ?
maybe he didn &apos;t know he got set up .
hey , everybody ?
uh , ammunition and firearm sales in this state are registered .
candice just bought 50 rounds of plus-p bullets at a gun shop in that mini-mall .
okay , rodney knows something about candice , and candice wants him dead before he can tell anybody .
all right , erica , shea , you &apos;re with me .
jules , keep me posted on the signal in candice &apos;s car .
lowery , keep digging into the relationship with rodney and lorraine .
see if you could figure out where they &apos;re headed .
hey , candice .
where &apos;s lorraine ?
i want to see her .
she &apos;s fine .
just drop the money .
i don &apos;t trust you .
you don &apos;t trust me ?
give him the money , mom .
you owe him that much .
come here , baby .
we figured out what you did .
you set rodney up .
you lied and tricked him into killing your husband .
you ruined his life .
you ruined mine .
give me the cash , bitch .
mom , don &apos;t !
no . lorraine .
couldn &apos;t have happened to a nicer lady .
clockwork-- here &apos;s your boy .
take care of it .
oh , come on , don &apos;t look so surprised to see me .
i told you i had contacts up the ass with law enforcement .
put a little moneyout there , you &apos;d be amazed how many leads come your way .
well , looks like it .
talk to you a second ?
ain &apos;t too late to cut a 50-50 deal , ray .
no deal .
stay out of my way , brad .
contacts my ass .
you dropped 80 bucks on a police scanner just like every other dumb bounty hunter .
yeah , better a bounty hunter that &apos;s dumb and alive than dead and smart like your daddy , huh ?
you want contacts , you piece of shit ?
hey , hey !
hey ! hey !
settle down !
i could kill you .
- i could kill you .
- get over there .
i &apos;m gonna kill him , ray !
get control of your cons , zancanelli .
don &apos;t come next to my team or my investigation again .
you will be arrested .
i can &apos;t wait till one of them stabs you in the back .
faster than you did ?
you cut a deal that sealed your file , that kept you out of prison .
you get that by rolling on me ?
whoever told you that was a liar .
you give me up , brad ? !
because if you did ,
i &apos;m not letting you take my job again .
you get one of those .
you put your hands on me , or anybody on my team again , and they &apos;ll be peeling you off the ground .
you got that ?
i &apos;m out of here .
listen to me .
i &apos;m gonna tell them that i pulled the trigger .
- no .
- yes .
the only thing that matters to me now is that you can have a happy life .... for both of us .
will you please do that for me ?
tomorrow morning i &apos;ll find a new car and then ... i &apos;ll leave .
i want to come with you .
you can &apos;t , lorraine .
we &apos;ll have tonight .
i &apos;ll go get some food .
no , i will .
they &apos;re looking for you .
is there something wrong , lloyd ?
just working .
man &apos;s got to do what a man &apos;s got to do ... in regard to work , so ...
i haven &apos;t done anything to upset you ?
just working .
what do you got , jules ?
local police just found the camaro in a town about ten miles up from where you are .
kelley must have gotten a heads up , because the tracking device on his truck shows him heading straight there .
all right , thanks . let &apos;s go .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
where &apos;s your boyfriend ?
huh ? !
he &apos;s in the motel ... up the street .
get your hands off her .
we can work this out , kid .
we &apos;re going for a ride .
think this through , kid .
about what the hell your doing .
get out of here , lorraine .
put the gun down , rodney .
he &apos;s a dead man unless you clear out !
ain &apos;t happening .
put the gun down .
- rodney , don &apos;t do this !
- get out of here !
- listen to your girl .
- don &apos;t be stupid .
i &apos;m driving out of here .
or he dies .
- go !
- no . this isn &apos;t you .
shoot him , ray . shoot him .
just put the gun down and give yourself up for me .
two seconds , rodney .
put the gun down , rodney .
i can &apos;t lose you .
put the gun down .
okay . okay .
two steps back , get up against that wall .
brad , step back !
hook him and put him in the car .
watch it , hey .
u.s. marshals coming in .
it &apos;s okay . go ahead .
i &apos;ll write you .
wrap it up . comen , get in there .
marshal detention officers will be here in a half hour to pick up rodney .
how &apos;s it going , iceman ?
i should sue you for malpractice .
it &apos;s harsh at first--
i should have warned you about that-- but you got to stick with it .
dividends are around the corner , my friend .
she &apos;s cracking .
i can tell .
um ... seeing that kelley isn &apos;t opposed to working with authorities , if he files charges against me for assault , i just ...
he took the first swing .
i &apos;ll back you up on that .
you &apos;re a stand-up guy , ray .
i was the recipient of some just awful advice .
it was well-intentioned but , uh ... completely ill-fitting for me .
i feel like ... ... every relationship or ... or pairing is unique , you know .
i mean , look at rodney and lorraine and what they went through to be together , and i realize that the only advice that i should have heeded is alfred lord tennyson &apos;s because i think it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all .
and i just want to tell you ... ... that i love you .
then i &apos;ll know .
or don &apos;t-- i mean , what-whatever makes you feel more comfortable .
but i need to say what i just said ... and ...
i &apos;m glad that i did .
transpo will be here in five minutes .
stick with it , iceman .
you heard him , let &apos;s go .
this is a pen ; i said a pencil .
jules , what does a pen mean ?
she ... she left me a pen .
hello , i would like you to touch wood
do you know this expression ?
the easiest way to understand it is referring to the heatwave of 2003 we have well known , may be more in the countryside with agricultural production .
in 2003 this is my place that &apos;s what grew and i did not harvested .
when we see this as a farmer one has the right to wonder about the future .
that &apos;s why i brought you wood that i will distribute .
touching wood , i think it &apos;s good
it makes you feel calm .
it &apos;s nice and it smells good .
here &apos;s a piece for each of you , if you want to distribute .
it &apos;s cherry and plum .
there are probably few in paris .
pass it to the others and we will do a simple experiment to show that these branches are the future of agriculture .
it seems crazy !
we hear of agriculture at the edge of the drama
and it is true that agriculture is on the brink and we are on the brink .
i &apos;ll show you the same experience as i had .
you take the branch and you do like that .
it can be shaped like a circle very easily .
and what i experienced in 2003 , in 2004 i did not experienced .
because the flexibility of these small branches that are produced every year growing every day the forest makes them .
the best model for agriculture is the forest because the forest does not need humans .
agriculture has derived to the assistantship , to technology .
farmers who don &apos;t understand ground anymore .
farmers have forgotten that the best model and pragmatism of life encourage us to watch the living .
from the living , the forest is the best example .
no human intervention no watering , no fertilizers , pesticides , fungicides it works alone .
when i discovered the flexibility of the small branch
i wondered : why the branches of large diameter break easily ?
whereas we can shape small branches as a circle that represent the virtuous circle of trees which produces branches in huge quantities .
i found on the internet an explanation of the forest and its soil .
we learn that leaves are attached to small branches it is not because they are fed up that they fall .
they restore 50 to 60 % of their content to the branches .
in this branch you are holding ,
there all the nutrients which allow buds in a few months to make new branches which contain branches for the following year .
trees restart their growth only with the content of the small branches .
on large diameter branches there are no such nutrients .
as you read this , you think you can already act individually and talk about it to friends and we will cut branches .
the more we are numerous and the more is the occasion to meet , to live well then we cut the branches , we gather them we make pile and grind it in a machine .
this is a technical operation , but not insurmountable .
in africa , we do it with a machete .
we spread it on the ground a layer of 3 to 5 cm , no more .
we realize that this is not prohibitive for a garden with this material which is hidden here .
i will open it later .
when it is placed on the ground in winter , spring we incorporate it .
you mean there is something about seasons ?
yes , indeed .
at the arrival of winter , the branches store nutrients .
it &apos;s going nowhere but in the branches , only at that time .
in the spring , those elements are diffused again .
so we proceed to what is called incorporation .
after a few weeks the agricultural soil that was here mainly stones has become this .
60 to 90 days after application of a 3 cm thick layer .
here is the top and there underneath .
we see mycelium , the real mushroom .
the mycelium is our collaborator to do what nature does only with mushrooms food chain with the lignin molecule .
the lignin molecule is very energetic and here comes a complex food chain of the soil .
the cultivated agricultural land becomes a forest soil .
it is a copy / paste of forest soil / agricultural land .
it works surprisingly for this stony soil with the rcw to grow wheat with yields almost higher than normal .
the surprise is enormous , because the trees grow too as well as vegetables .
there you are on limestone plateaus of quercy i invite you to my place .
i brought you bracnches from my place , but here it is .
zucchini grow in full sun .
no watering , just seedlings .
i plant the seeds in the ground and wait for it to grow .
this year , with 12 zucchinis , i picked up 190 kilos .
no watering , no phytosanitary treatment , no weed control .
it might looks like the garden of eden we put the seeds in the ground and harvest .
these are my productions .
unfeasible on the plateau .
when you say you are going to grow carrots on limestone plateaus everyone says it , agronomists , experts there are 30 to 40 % of stones , 30 cm of soil , impossible .
no water , no fertilizer , no treatment .
yields are 160 to 170 % .
the amount of dry matter is 30 % extra .
which means that the plants have less water and are tastier they overcook less easily and preservation is much longer .
no evidence of disease , plague , aphids or pests
it seems magical .
no human intervention .
it is like facing the forest without human intervention .
is it still agriculture ?
is this a new concept ?
even in mali , burkina faso , togo , gestures are the same , the results are the same .
when small branches are grinded , we put a thin layer on the floor we see the same phenomenon .
mushrooms of a certain family will take nutrients triggers a food chain which induces life returning in soil .
i have not mentioned the name , but it is rcw
w for wood
r for ramial , branches you have in your hand a very special part of the tree bearing leaves , where photosynthesis happens .
energy from the sun , transformed by the leaves is stored in the branches
this concept bothers agronomy , the farming profession must be reinvented .
you imagine a farm with 20 to 30 % of forest area or wood .
it can occur without soil conditioner with 50 % less water at least and a yield of 160 to 170 % .
you do it every 4-5 years .
it is about sustainability
this concept affects many people but research has difficulties to take it in account .
this package , for those who want , we can share it because it works in the garden , in a flower pot , with a lemon tree or a plant that you like .
you put a layer of 3 to 5 cm thick and it works !
you will have the most beautiful fruits less watering needs and besides it &apos;s beautiful , it smells good .
for those that want to smell and take some there is a characteristic smell of forest .
i invite you to share this meal with the ground .
c of rcw stands for chipped
subtitle and translation :
this is a rocket stove .
rocket stoves generally create much more efficient combustion and are better able to store heat than conventionnal stoves .
on the inside of the barrel but on the outside of the part that comes up in the middle .
all the flue gas will travel down around the outside of the barrel and out through the back and up , out of the chimney .
all this cob here that surrounds the stove is designed to capture the heat from the combustion so that it &apos;s not just all going straight up the chimney .
with a conventionnal stove the heat tends to travel out of the building very quickly .
this allows for more of the heat to be stored in the building and then slowly the heat is released over time out of the cob .
so , this is the sky house rocket stove
it is a sort of a wall in between our dinning room and our living room .
basically , you got the intake here the barrel is here and you can see there is a very large amount of cob surrounding most of the barrel here .
this entire wall is actually a cob wall .
so , here we are on the other side of the wall , in the dining room .
here is the other side of the barrel encased in cob and then the flue of the rocket stove runs all the way through this bench and up that chimney .
one of the benefit of the rocket stove is that you can have a long horizontal run of your flue pipe and you can monitor a bench or under a bed or wherever you want to store that heat .
normally we have a table here so this one of the seat of the table , that is very popular when we are in winter cause this area gonna stay warm pretty much all day until the evening if we fire the rocket stove that day .
there is about 4 to 6 inches of cob on top of the flue here on the bench so they can take a few hours before it heats up .
i would say 2 or 3 hours but then it wil stay warm throughout the day .
the front of the rocket stove there is only about 2 inches between the flue and the front and that heats up a little faster sometimes it is almost a little too hot so that 4 inches is really great if it &apos;s going to be an area , where you are physically in contact with .
like this bench .
we oil the bench to waterproof it cause it is near the table .
the chimney runs up as cob all the way up into the second story and that , again stores thermal mass up into the bedrooms , upstairs as well .
welcome to basalt mountain located on the northern rim of the roaring fork valley in colorado .
the climate here is hot and dry in the summer and frigid in the winter .
to the point were only a small number of plant and animal species can survive here. until now no one would have considered farming in this dry rocky nutrient poor soil .
but thanks to our current understanding of nature ’ s natural processes one man has built up a nutrient rich soil upon this dry undesirable clay forming the foundation for a thriving ecosystem
i came to colorado in 1969 and i spent about the first seven or eight , ten years
as a ski instructor. and gradually got interested in healthy foods
through having somewhat of a health crisis with hyperglycemia so i decided to look into wild foods and that lead me into growing my own gardens and using wild foods when it was available
jerome began gardening in the lowlands of the basalt area with the understand that it would be too difficult to grow near his home on basalt mountain due to the arid soils and difficulty in harnessing water but once i learned about permaculture
i found that it was totally possible to create these beautiful gardens using recycled materials , and building compost , sheet mulching , using perennial and annual vegetables in combinations of designs
but jerome ’ s success in permaculture hasn ’ t come without some major road blocks
in 2008 a devastating fire burned down one of his first tropical greenhouse ’ s
ironically named pele &#91; after the hawaiian fire goddess &#93; to the ground. the fire in pele was actually a blessing in disguise. because we were able to take new technology and design a much bigger , better greenhouse .
so i worked with michael thomson my partner in ecosystems design to redesign the new greenhouse .
at the time that pele burned down jerome had been working with well know local architect michael thompson on advancing greenhouse design by introducing what jerome called “ climate battery technology ”
the destruction of pele gave the two the chance to put their latest research to the test and in the spirit on new beginnings the new greenhouse would be named phoenix after the mythological bird that burns itself and rises from the ashes to live through another cycle .
hi i ’ m michael thompson ,
i ’ m chief architect with ecosystems design in basalt colorado and partner with jerome osentowski .
the climate battery as we now call it , is a series of tubing in which air is taken in at the high point of the greenhouse , pumped through tubing , and exhausted at the south end of the greenhouse .
and then that air circulates over and over again picking up heat and then delivering it underground and storing it .
so at ecosystems design , we create designs for greenhouses and passive solar buildings and homes as well as outdoor landscaping perennials and annuals for organic agriculture in the rocky mountain region. in addition to designing indoor and outdoor permaculture and edible landscapes
we create the buildings that allow that indoor growing , such as this one in steamboat springs .
so all of these fans are delivering air through these vertical risers which then underground distribute the warm air through these horizontal manifolds through these perforated tubes that deliver the heat and the moisture from that air into the soil for use later in the cold nights .
where we can start the plants in february that will grow outdoors as annuals .
we also have climate control equipment like these curtains that draw across underneath the glazing at night when its very cold so we have an extra insulating layer for accomplishing that .
thanks for watching
water is life .
bassin de rétention d &apos;eau à tamera ( portugal )
avec sepp holzer et benrd müiler
water is life .
water is the most important thing .
the whole world is 70 % water .
we , animals , everything-70 % water .
water is the key issue for the survival human kind on this planet .
nature has provided enough water everywhere on earth ; but , a billion people do not have sufficient access to clean drinking water .
more and more regions lack the water to grow the food they need .
centralized systems of artificial water management cannot solve this problem .
we need de-centralized systems of natural water management .
we are in tamera peace research center in southern portugal , where a water retention landscape has been in development since summer 2007 .
bernd muller is responsible for tamera &apos;s ecological research work .
in 2007 the community of tamera still had the question whether a site of this size threatened by desertification could provide food , water and energy for 300 people .
we visited sepp holzer and asked him this question and he brought us this gift the vision of a water landscape .
sepp holzer , an austrian mountain farmer , is a well-known specialist and visionary for permaculture and landscape healing .
water is always at the core of his work .
for me water is the most important capital .
wherever it &apos;s possible , you should create retention spaces and collect the rain water and re-learn with the water how to maintain a balance .
this is the most important thing because once you &apos;ve created the right hydrological balance , 70 % of the work is done. ou help rich vegetation to develop , diversity ecause nature can reveal itself and develop in the right way .
traveling through the world i have not seen a single situation , nation or land in which the development of a water retention landscape would not give the first important healing impulses .
in many parts of the world , countries are not able to feed their population anymore .
they have been unable to maintain their natural wildlife for a long time .
as a consultant in many countries
sepp holzer sees the consequence of deforestation , monoculture , overgrazing and industrial agriculture .
all these factors destroy the natural water balance .
the soil is drying out .
water is being lost and the retention space , the natural water storage system of the earth , is becoming dry and the flora and fauna disappear .
in the end the land will turn into desert or burn ecause it &apos;s so dry .
you can see these problems happening all over the world , bringing huge catastrophes .
and the heavy rains come anyway .
what happens then ?
the water rushes down the slopes because the dry soil does not absorb the water .
when the soil is hotter than the falling rain it rejects the water .
only when the soil is cooler , when the vegetation is giving shadow then it attracts the water and lets it seep in .
this is the construction site for a new water retention space in tamera .
wherever you work with soil you can read the signs of erosion .
topsoil should actually form a thick , living layer everywhere on the ground which enables rainwater to filter in .
but , this layer has been eroded away .
now the topsoil lies in layers many meters thick in the bottom of valleys or is found as mud in rivers .
the surface of fields and sites higher up is depleted and barren .
de-centralized water retention landscapes give the water time to filter back into the earth body .
people always have the same questions , always the same worries , where will all this water come from ? in such dusty dry soil without streams or a river .
how can i build a lake here ?
people have simply lost the knowledge of how to use the catchment area and the rain , the blessing of the water in the right way .
when i use the catchment area , thereupon , the lake will fill very quickly .
how much water can change a landscape in a short time .
we can see here , comparing tamera before the creation of lake 1 and today .
water retention landscapes can be built everywhere .
anywhere on earth .
a water retention space must not be sealed with concrete or plastic .
it is enough to build a dam out of natural material at the narrowest point of a valley .
you dig a ditch until you reach an impermeable layer .
on that solid ground you apply layer after layer of fine material , like moist clay and drive on it and roll it to build the water barrier .
this water barrier is the core of the dam .
for the outside of the dam i take course material , it doesn &apos;t have to be dense and water-proof .
of course , i will also have to compact it by driving on it and rolling it .
and like this , i build the whole dam , the water barrier in the core nd on the outside in a slope of 1 to 2 , 1 meter up and 2 meters along ,
the water retention spaces have winding banks , shallow and deep zones , a diverse vegetation of water plants and are built aligned to the prevailing wind direction this way the water is always moving , is enriched with oxygen , and thus is naturally purified .
the water in a water retention landscape stays fresh and alive by itself .
since we created the first retention space , we can already keep much of the water from the winter rainfalls on the land .
in this way in can unfold its full healing capacity , the wildlife is responding and is returning and the vegetation is recovering .
we can plant fruit trees again , the forests recover and we can grow our food for people and for animals in the direct surroundings of the first retention space .
the water which used to run away and which is now stored here is at the same time also having an impact on the whole groundwater system .
in the first year , a spring developed below this lake which now gives water throughout the year .
since we built this first dam , we no longer have such big variations with a lot of flowing water in winter when it &apos;s raining and droughts in the summer .
we have a more constant water situation throughout the year , which is of course a huge benefit for nature .
nature shows you how this works , you just have to ask her , have to contact her , to communicate with her , then you will be fine anywhere on earth .
ask nature , think with her and not against her .
put yourself in her place and you get all the answers you need .
make room in your head so that natural thinking has space to happen .
a forest garden is a three dimensional garden of useful plants .
this is looking quite good at the moment .
this is chinese dogwood , which is as you can see , a fantastic beautiful plant in flower but actually has a very nice edible fruit which follows later in the year .
so there is plants for all sources of different uses . there &apos;s ...
i think forest gardens will have a role to play they are ... you know there is an awful lot of interest at the moment in forest gardens .
of course mainstream agriculture of course is completely dependent on oil , and you know what happens to oil will have a big effect and of course the oil price will may certainly go up and up over the decades to come , because , you know , demand will exceed supply .
so that &apos;s a potential problem that could slow down , you know , the implementation of more agroforestry based systems on farming .
but i think it needs to happen and i think slowly it will happen but ...
i think it will take ... unfortunalety i think it will take a crisis or two , you know a serious crisis or two , to actually jolt the powers of be into actually you know , making it happen quicker .
this is one of my main salad leaves from the forest garden , it &apos;s the young leaf you use , this kind of leaf , not the old one , the old ones would be tough .
and of course that &apos;s got to be sensible from our sustainability and our resilience aspects , it &apos;s got to be sensible and our governments haven &apos;t got it yet .
forest gardens are resilient because of the ... because of the diversity , really .
and i suspect ... you know diverse diet will lead to more resilient people as well .
bamboos are fantastically useful plants and of course in china and japan or other parts of asia they use bamboo for more things that you could think of .
this garden is now 16 years old and ... i &apos;ve certainly seen i &apos;ve seen climate changes in that time mainly , you know , increased average temperatures and fewer spring frosts .
fungi are probably the most important organisms of all in this forest garden , and of course most of the time we don &apos;t see it because they are under the soil surface and ... the fungi i am talking about are mycorrhizal fungi which are beneficial fungi that form relationships with almost all plant roots .
and they do some amazing things : when they form an association with plant roots they basically give the plant hard to get nutrients because fungi can get those out of the ground much more efficiently than plants and the plant gives the fungi some sugars in return , so it &apos;s kind of symbiosis .
so that &apos;s how things like nitrogen from my nitrogen fixing trees gets around to fruit trees that need it the fungi move it for you .
the other thing that this fungi do , which has really just been discovered in the last few years is critical in sequestering carbon in stable states in the soil . so without them you wouldn &apos;t get sequestration into the soil .
and of course you don &apos;t get these fungi where you dig the soil .
and this huge potential you know for sequestering more carbon into the soil you know ... and certainly you know , everybody seems to want to do that but ... but to do that , you gonna have to move to a much more perennial system .
this is pokeroot which is a quite a well known american wild edible . weedy shoots that come through which tend to be at the beginning of june so it &apos;s kind of very late spring crop really and the shoots come as really thick like you can see here .
you cook those and they have a sort of healthy asparagus flavor to them really , really substantial vegetable .
i mean my estimate is that you could certainly feed 4-5 people of an acre of forest garden .
monoculture crops have been dominating all agriculture research for hundreds of years and even now you know mainstream agriculture scientists they don &apos;t like looking at more than one crop in one place , it makes things very complicated for them .
it &apos;s actually that pink shell which is the spice you don &apos;t have to use black pepper if you have something like this .
i never dreamed before
i &apos;m gonna knock the door into the world of perfect free ( you ain &apos;t no lonely ! )
you &apos;re gonna say i &apos;m lying i &apos;m gonna get the chance
i thought a chance is far from me ( you ain &apos;t no lonely ! )

&quot; c-major pentatonic scale &quot;
it &apos;s too hard for me .
but it &apos;s better to learn the scale early .
you stupid bird !
i &apos;ll show you !
don &apos;t rush it , koyuki-kun .
it &apos;s only been two months since you started playing the guitar .
but he already knows the scale ...
let &apos;s go swimming !
&quot; lucille &quot;
umm ... so please buy your own melon roll .
it &apos;s the truth . i was called to the faculty office .
s-see you ...
hold it , tanaka !
yukio tanaka of grade 8b .
please go to the faculty office immediately .
i repeat ...
listen , tanaka-kun ...
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re taking your job as umbrella monitor seriously .
oh , no ...
daily life is a series of little jobs like this .
maybe i should put this in your student report ...
i &apos;m disappointed in you , tanaka-kun .
you may go .
wait , tanaka-kun !
what is this ? !
what happened ? !
oh ... it &apos;s nothing .
we were kidding around and tanabe-kun did a drop kick on me .
and naturally , i gave it back to him with a heel hold ! so it &apos;s no big deal !
-did you catch that game ? -yeah !
that was awesome !
you look glum , koyuki !
maho , you sure eat a lot .
shut up .
i &apos;m hungry .
you &apos;ll gain weight .
you can have my fries .
beck &apos;s first live performance has been set !
how long is this going to continue ?
i &apos;ll talk to him for you .
okay , i &apos;m going on deliveries , so make up for being late and work extra hard .
i &apos;m sorry !
and don &apos;t forget to feed page .
-he sure is strict . -yeah .
around strangers .
it &apos;s okay , i &apos;ll feed him .
-he &apos;s ...
-you little- !
t-this is the last of it !
these aren &apos;t company documents !
they &apos;re saito-san &apos;s personal treasure !
i mean , private collection .
koyuki , how long have you been working here ?
-since the end of summer break .
i want to repair the guitar ryusuke-kun gave me .
i didn &apos;t know ...
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want to see ryusuke-kun until the guitar is fixed .
so , how much do you get paid ?
oh , umm ... 430 yen an hour .
are you serious ? !
that &apos;s crazy !
this new law sure is bad for the manufacturing industry .
-saito-sama , this way please .
thank you for waiting . rie-chan !
thank you for calling her .
-oh , it &apos;s ken-ken ! -rie-rie !
-i missed you sooo much !
-me too !
what &apos;s with the get-up ?
caught a cold or something ?
i &apos;m in disguise !
but how &apos;d you guess it was me ?
you stand out too much .
okay , it &apos;s starting !
ryusuke-kun &apos;s guitar ... are those bullet marks ? !
they &apos;re real .
is that ...
that guitar has a name ... it &apos;s lucille .
-sounds like a woman &apos;s name .
ryusuke got it in some dangerous place .
but ... it couldn &apos;t possibly have happened while he was performing ? !
one , two !
typhoon 24 !
24 hours straight !
we &apos;re gonna send you flyin &apos; head-first !
lift up your heavy ass , now if you take off that stiff head you &apos;ll feel totally loose
this crazy , crazy world
you just have to stage dive or die
mind blower , a shower of sweat run towards a new world , my life
those who seek it will be rewarded pass the hot shot , keep on coming , come on !
blow your mind
squeeze your sweat yeah
blow your mind squeeze your sweat
this ... is beck ...
there &apos;s still more ? !
-the guitar &apos;s fixed now . -huh ? !
the one with the broken neck . i sent it out for repairs .
i-is that true ? !
you want to patch things up with ryusuke , don &apos;t you ?
now go , hurry !
koyuki-kun ... deduction for leaving early .
i think this &apos;ll do .
if you notice something while playing it , just let me know .
now i can see ryusuke-kun !
hey , tanaka ...
hey , tanaka . lemme play that guitar .
what an awful sound ... suits you perfectly !
hey , masaru .
forget it , rikiya-kun .
the sound is the pits .
you laughed just now , didn &apos;t you ?
-don &apos;t act innocent !
no , i thought that tune was &quot; anarchy in heaven &quot; ...
recently , the sex handles-
any complaints ?
didn &apos;t think so .
it was a piece of junk anyway .
let &apos;s go , masaru !
-how about new burger ?
did you get it , koyuki-kun ?
oh , good !
it &apos;s all fixed , then ?
actually , it &apos;s been slow here at saito paper company , so getting the money to fix it was a bit hard .
but it was worth it to see you smiling again !
saito-san ... thank you !
oh , you &apos;re welcome !
mom used to say , &quot; from that day on , yukio was like someone possessed by the guitar , and played it every single day . &quot;
you were great at the concert !
think so ? !
i just looove your vocals , chiba-kun !
we won &apos;t miss your next live performance !
then i &apos;ll put you on the guest list !
give me your names and numbers !
hey , ray !
i &apos;ve gotta talk to you !
what &apos;re you mad about all of a sudden ? wow !
ryusuke-kun , you speak english !
i lived in new york for a long time . so i &apos;m more used to english than japanese .
-that &apos;s so cool ! -that &apos;s so cool !
we &apos;ve got to go to new york , too !
-tell us where you used to live !
we wanna visit it !
i was looking for the ab machine i bought by mail order last night ... and i finally found it !
found what ?
this is it ... the l48 eddie gave to you !
then the one i gave to koyuki was ...
that was a fake one you got at the guitar shop in queens !
which means ...
don &apos;t get tetanus !
i called ryusuke too .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
oh , speak of the devil .
maho ... did you really explain it to him ?
i did !
why am i running away ? !
i spoke to ryusuke-kun on the phone yesterday and he said to say hi .
oh ... can you say hello from me , too ?
all 9th graders will report to the gym for curriculum guidance .
i repeat ...
-it &apos;s almost graduation .
i &apos;ll be lonely .
see you , koyuki !
&quot; dear koyuki-kun , &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ve decided to stay here a bit longer , so please take care of page ! &quot;
he &apos;s extending his stay again !
southeast asia must have something that lures grown men ...
i haven &apos;t played yet !
punk rockers hold their guitars low ...
i &apos;d better go to sleep !
look at him ...
didn &apos;t he make his band successful all by himself ?
we just do things our way .
umm ... ginger ale .
hey , koyuki !
why &apos;d you run away the other day ? !
koyuki ! let &apos;s go up front !
let &apos;s go concrete hell , human safari park escape
ape in the brain , mass brain-washing operation , no thank you
let &apos;s walk together , step in step , and we &apos;ll get stuck in the deep
-i-is this what rap is ?
-let &apos;s walk together , step in step , and we &apos;ll get stuck in the deep -i-is this what rap is ?
you say something ?
-we &apos;re at the rebellious age , free as we go this is no barrier , just what is important , nothing impure , just clear
no pressure at our pace
takes me cruisin&apos;
music that cuts through the wind , free form
bullet holes in the body ...
that &apos;s a creepy guitar ...
the acoustic pick-up in the front is broken .
he has a roger mayer at his feet .
but ... how is he getting such a sound ?
wow ! amazing !
-hey , look at that poster !
-i &apos;m gonna get a shot of it !
so this is where ryusuke-kun grew up ! isn &apos;t it cool !
that dog ...
another minute feelin &apos; so fine
you turn the freeze into warm light
had a premonition i &apos;ve been waitin &apos; ever since
my world comin &apos; down
it &apos;s got me spinnin &apos; &apos; round
if you really wanna fly you gotta let go
simply the most big sensation ( once you &apos;re here you won &apos;t go back )
she &apos;s really pretty
one-eyed vision ( lose the fear it don &apos;t come back )

&quot; next episode &quot;
that &apos;s me .
jane quimby .
my life is a little complicated right now .
i landed my fashion dream job working for her ,
gray chandler murray .
the only problem , they think i &apos;m an adult .
now i am juggling two secret lives , one in high school and one in high fashion .
do you trust india ?
i just think she &apos;s a little shady .
i &apos;m afraid we have to say goodbye .
i hope you &apos;re happy .
you did this to yourself , india .
you got the wrong person .
all right , fellas .
here &apos;s how it &apos;s going down .
are you robbing this place , tommy ?
a couple months at new hall youth detention might give mr. nutter ample time to think about those mistakes and their implications .
i saw her with nick .
they were kissing , janey .
it &apos;s not what you think .
- just let me ...
- don &apos;t .
i can &apos;t talk to you .
and you really deserve the perfect guy , rita shaw .
you are perfect .
i really have no idea how to say this .
so i &apos;m just gonna say it .
it &apos;s you , janey .
you &apos;re gonna be late for school again , truant .
that guidance counselor of yours is gonna come down on you hard .
you know how miss shaw can be .
it &apos;s a little weird that you call your girlfriend &quot; miss shaw . &quot;
oh , you mean rita .
are you really that busy ?
and no .
i &apos;m nervous , ben .
two months is a long time .
what if billy &apos;s different ?
what if he doesn &apos;t want to see me ?
jane . he was in a juvenile detention center , not a brainwashing camp .
you &apos;ll be the first person he wants to see .
besides , why would anything be different with you two ?
well , the thing is i might not have told you everything that happened that night at the fashion show .
see , when billy showed up he sort of ...
well , he ...
i &apos;m waiting .
bated breath over here .
he said something .
and would you like to tell me what that something was , exactly ?
he said , &quot; it &apos;s you . &quot;
- it &apos;s you ?
- yeah .
- oh , boy .
- what ?
then what happened ?
well , then jeremy came in and i didn &apos;t know what to do and then billy ran out and the next morning he got sent away and for the past two months it &apos;s been playing on a loop in my head .
&quot; it &apos;s you , it &apos;s you , it &apos;s you . &quot;
what do you think it means ?
well , i may be totally off-base here , but did you ever think he might have meant it romantically ?
no , no , no .
i did think that for a second .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s it .
but i guess it can be .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it is .
i don &apos;t know .
would that be so weird ?
well , he &apos;s my best friend and i don &apos;t want to run the risk of ruining that , right ?
- i can &apos;t answer that .
- then what good are you ?
just go pick up billy and you two will figure it out .
you know why ?
because you guys are like this .
you can figure out anything .
i sure hope so .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .

that &apos;s it ?
yeah , i mean , i don &apos;t know what else to say .
it was pretty uneventful .
you were in a juvenile detention center .
so , was it scary ?
were the guards mean ?
did you make any friends ?
how was the food ?
jane . look .
i wasn &apos;t in alcatraz or anything , okay ?
i just ...
i &apos;d rather talk about something else , okay ?
maybe we should talk about , you know ...
yeah , you !
so , what about you ?
what &apos;s been going on with that whole super secret double life of yours since i &apos;ve been away ?
oh . nothing , really .
- how &apos;s jeremy ?
- jeremy ?
yeah , you guys are together , right ?
we &apos;ve never been together .
he doesn &apos;t even know that i &apos;m in high school .
and we work together .
i could never do that .
speaking of work .
how is it ?
well , things have been crazy ever since india got fired .
gray has been using me for everything .
it &apos;s nuts .
and she &apos;s been through at least a dozen people to fill india &apos;s job . wow .
that &apos;s a lot of people .
tell me about it .
and you should see the stuff that she &apos;s having me do .
i can &apos;t even believe it .
i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong ,
i love being creatively involved at donovan decker ...
you okay ?
let &apos;s just say to be back here again .
and this place same way about me .
don &apos;t worry about them .
and , billy ...
are we okay ?
shouldn &apos;t we , talk or something ?
you &apos;ve been talking non-stop ever since we got in the car , jane .
i mean , about ...
we &apos;re good .
there &apos;s nothing for us to talk about , okay ?
unless you want to talk about that .
you have got to be kidding me .
lulu and nick .
they &apos;ve been an item ever since you left school .
looks like it &apos;s just back to being the two of us .
the two of us .
jane , i have to be honest .
i &apos;m a little disappointed .
i &apos;m just surprised .
that &apos;s all .
this progress report does not reflect the academic performance of the jane quimby that i know .
your grades are slipping in every class but ceramics .
well , that &apos;s good , right ?
- your brother got an a in ceramics .
- ouch .
and it &apos;s not just your grades .
your attendance last month ?
let &apos;s just say it was less than perfect .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
this internship is interfering with your life .
your grades aren &apos;t what they used to be , you have multiple tardies and absences and that just can &apos;t happen .
i know , i know .
but i &apos;m not just looking off into the future for my dream job .
i mean , i &apos;m already here .
this is my life .
it &apos;s just an internship , jane .
i &apos;m working with designers and i &apos;m being exposed to this whole world of fashion that you can &apos;t learn in a classroom .
i &apos;m living it every day .
you can &apos;t buy that kind of experience , you know ?
but i need to see some real changes .
because if this doesn &apos;t improve , i can &apos;t sign off on the internship program for you next semester .
especially if you &apos;re not ...
are you texting someone right now ?
i am just typing a reminder to myself to shape up at school .
i promise i &apos;ll get things back on track at school .
you have my word .
i know this might sound harsh , but you &apos;ve been an incredible disappointment , sally .
it &apos;s suzy .
your work has been lackluster .
your ideas , well , you simply have none .
in your time here at donovan decker , you &apos;ve yet to show any real promise .
but i &apos;ve only been working here for two days .
two days too many , i &apos;m afraid .
you &apos;re fired .
that &apos;ll be all .
that &apos;s five this month , gray .
well , it &apos;s been harder to replace india than i might &apos;ve realized .
perhaps if you ...
but i &apos;m not worried .
i have a new prospect in mind .
someone young and unexpected .
someone not boxed in by years of design experience .
you don &apos;t mean ...
you &apos;re not talking about ...
i have to go .
my next appointment is here .
oh , hi .
- hi .
- hi .
gray , darling !
it &apos;s a whole new delicious look to match your title of creative director .
what do you think ?
do you like it ?
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t .
i love it .
you &apos;re a genius .
thank you , carter .
girl , how many hats does gray have you wearing right now ?
more than you own .
i doubt that .
am i the only one that &apos;s twice as busy since india left ?
i think we &apos;re all starting to feel the pressure .
but you more than anyone .
&apos;cause whenever gray says jump ...
i say , &quot; over whom ? &quot;
and , &quot; in pumps or flats ? &quot;
i just really hope this new girl works out .
well , don &apos;t get your hopes up .
what can i do for you , muffin ?
that &apos;s a &quot; no &quot; on kissing at work and the whole muffin thing .
yeah , i know .
it didn &apos;t quite feel right coming out .
i need the kids here to respect me , ben .
we need to be professional .
got it .
we &apos;re on the same page .
so , what &apos;s up ?
i had a conversation with jane this morning .
i &apos;m just a little concerned .
don &apos;t worry .
she &apos;s good with it .
- with what ?
- with us dating .
no . ben . i &apos;m concerned about jane .
i just got her progress report and she &apos;s falling behind .
i think this internship is just too demanding on her , don &apos;t you ?
actually , i kind of think it &apos;s been good .
but i promise i &apos;ll make sure she stays focused on school .
you know why ?
because your love life depends on it ?
i know you &apos;ve all been working tremendously hard lately .
but you &apos;re gonna have to work tremendously harder .
donovan decker has been selected to collaborate on a capsule collection with one of the world &apos;s most famous luxury department stores ,
that is , unless we blow it .
and we cannot blow it .
didn &apos;t i fire you ?
see me in my office afterwards .
the style director assigned to oversee our harrods collection will be coming by tomorrow .
now , can anyone tell me what is our number one priority ?
um , to impress the style director and ensure harrods is confident that donovan decker has what it takes ?
now , i need all hands on deck for the next two days .
no exceptions .
is that clear ?
if that is clear , then walk away and get back to work .
can i talk to you for a moment ?
as long as gray doesn &apos;t see .
because apparently , we &apos;re all supposed to be working tremendously harder than we were before .
whatever that means .
did you hear that she fired sally ?
- do you mean suzy ?
- right .
oh , my gosh .
i &apos;m turning into gray , aren &apos;t i ?
- jane ...
- not that that would be a bad thing .
- i just think ... what ?
- jane !
i &apos;m going to tell you something and i need you not to react , okay ?
- okay ?
- no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m serious , jane .
gray is giving you india &apos;s old job .
no reaction .
take over india &apos;s job ?
i am so not ready for that .
then you best get ready .
you ready ?
i &apos;ll be out in a minute !
- morning , miss shaw .
- good morning , billy .
you mind handing me the milk ?
of course .
oh , and miss shaw ?
yes , billy ?
i think your toast is ready .
you &apos;re actually considering this ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , taking india &apos;s old job would be the opportunity of a lifetime .
how could i say no ?
- what &apos;s wrong ?
- nothing , i ...
i just ...
you &apos;d really consider leaving here ?
just leaving school behind ?
no reason .
talk to me , billy .
no , i &apos;m good .
oh , you &apos;re good ?
is that right ?
yeah . it is .
- fine .
- so , now you &apos;re mad at me ?
i am .
billy , you &apos;ve been shutting me out .
about everything .
what is going on with you ?
and how can i help if you won &apos;t even talk to me ?
what do you want to talk about ?
for starters , how about the fashion show ?
you ran out before we could even have a conversation .
it was nothing , janey .
that &apos;s your story ?
look , i was in a bad place .
i was getting sent away .
that &apos;s it .
there &apos;s nothing for us to talk about .
things are different now .
i &apos;m different .
yeah , tell me about it .
what is that supposed to mean ?
it means you have changed .
and , if you ask me , it &apos;s not for the better .
i didn &apos;t ask you , jane .
then be that way !
- i will !
- well , then do it !
i said i will !
what was that about ?
i don &apos;t know , ben .
maybe i took your advice and i tried to talk to him about the whole &quot; it &apos;s you &quot; thing and maybe it backfired .
sorry about that .
i &apos;m worried about billy .
it can &apos;t be easy for him to fall back into his old life here .
well , maybe you could help him find something positive to focus on ?
such as ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe an activity or something ?
like mathletes .
or chess club .
- i &apos;m being serious , rita .
- so am i.
what , do you want him to be more of an outcast ?
those are terrible clubs .
i was in those clubs , ben .
and you were adorable doing it .
vice principal jenkins !
what a surprise to see you !
in the hall .
at school .
where we work .
hey , rita .
what &apos;re you naughty kids up to this fine morning ?
why would you even ...
we are ... were ...
we were just talking .
that is all .
i said &quot; mop &quot; !
- and i &apos;ll stop talking now .
- good idea .
good morning , jenkins .
good morning , rita .
that was close .
that was awkward .
really awkward .
what &apos;s gotten into you ?
you said you want to keep it professional at work , right ?
- do you think he knows ?
- knows what ?
about you and me , of course .
how would he know that , ben ?
are you kidding ?
we ooze chemistry .
don &apos;t say ooze .
how are you , billy ?
oh , you know how it is , just trying to get my bearings back .
- that &apos;s good .
- yep .
so , what &apos;s been going on with you ?
stupid question .
so , you and fadden , huh ?
how &apos;s that one working out for you ?
to be honest , i thought it was going pretty well .
that is until you got back .
i thought i could forget about us , b ...
there is no more us , lu .
but i really do hope things between you and nick work out .
because you deserve it .
you &apos;re precipitating .
- excuse me ?
- your calcium is starting to form a precipitate .
you should dry out the crystals .
- busy , huh ?
- mmm-hmm .
you &apos;re not gonna cut me any slack here , are you ?
but just a little .
i guess i deserve that .
i &apos;m really sorry , jane .
for what it &apos;s worth , i made a big mistake .
huge , in fact .
and i regret it .
it &apos;s fine .
really , i &apos;m just distracted .
and you know what ?
i think it all worked out for the best .
you and lulu seem very happy .
the thing is ...
is everything okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s just , um ...
oh , i , uh ...
i have to go .
you wanted to see me , ben ?
good hands .
good hands .
first day back .
how &apos;re you doing ?
i &apos;m fine , ben .
oh , i get it .
this must be the part where you ask me how i &apos;m adjusting .
no , i just thought now that you &apos;re back , you might want to hit the ground running .
find a positive outlet .
for what ?
i don &apos;t know , something to keep you busy .
focus your energy .
how about football ?
you got a pair of hands on you .
i mean , you &apos;re a little stringy , but you &apos;re probably very elusive .
hard to tackle .
oh , my .
are you kidding me right now ?
why not just give it a shot ?
look , ben .
i appreciate you trying to help reacclimate me or whatever it is that you &apos;re trying to do here .
but , in case you hadn &apos;t noticed , i &apos;m not really the team sport type .
are you sure you &apos;re doing okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
because , jane told me about ...
do you really want to do this , benjamin ?
- i &apos;d like to .
- i &apos;d prefer if we didn &apos;t .
coming through .
hi , guys .
i have to leave school because of an emergency at work and rita can &apos;t know under any circumstances because then i would lose my internship and that can &apos;t happen .
so i really need you guys to help me out okay ?
can you cover for me ?
- i don &apos;t think so .
- no way .
look , i know that you are mad at me and that you don &apos;t really like to do this sort of thing , but can &apos;t you just cover for me ?
maybe like a cold , cramps , anything .
i don &apos;t like lying to rita .
it &apos;s just a teeny-tiny little white lie .
and that &apos;s how it all starts .
that &apos;s correct .
i don &apos;t need your help .
i can handle this on my own .
that &apos;s okay .
hey , i &apos;m actually a little lost .
oh , well , maybe i can point you in the right direction .
who are you delivering those to ?
you think i &apos;m a flower delivery guy ?
a second ago .
but now i &apos;m a little unsure .
they &apos;re for gray chandler murray .
oh . great .
i &apos;m gray &apos;s assistant .
so i can just take those to her .
i &apos;d rather give them to her myself if that &apos;s okay .
the thing is gray &apos;s not exactly the hand delivery type .
what type is she ?
she &apos;s more of a &quot; don &apos;t bother me with that kind of crap &quot; type .
so , if you &apos;re not the flower delivery guy , who are you ?
i have an appointment with gray .
no , it &apos;s tomorrow .
i just thought i &apos;d get here early in case i got lost .
why would you get here a whole day ...
oh , that was a joke .
- funny .
- you didn &apos;t laugh .
well , it wasn &apos;t laugh out loud funny .
the thing is gray doesn &apos;t have any appointments today .
well , she called me directly .
called you ?
on the phone ?
crazy , right ?
so , what is this appointment about ?
something about a job opening .
a job .
and you &apos;re interviewing for it ?
are you gonna point me in the right direction or should i ...
oh , gosh .
yes , sorry .
right this way .
so , you got any tips for me ?
yeah , you know , like advice for the interview .
oh , um , just don &apos;t take anything gray says to you personally .
she can be a little cold .
so , you &apos;re saying she &apos;s mean ?
oh , no , no , no .
not mean .
- she &apos;s just not very ...
- nice ?
eli , you &apos;re here !
and you brought me flowers .
yeah , well , i haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
and i know lilies are your favorite .
jane , i see you &apos;ve met my nephew , eli .
yeah , we ...
jane was actually just talking about you .
oh . and what did she say ?
only that you &apos;re warm and gorgeous and incredibly talented .
is that right ?
that is right .
eli , come into my office .
jane , hold all my calls .
it was nice to meet you , jane .
who is that ?
his name is eli .
i don &apos;t like the look of him .
well , you should probably keep that one to yourself .
and why is that ?
because he is gray &apos;s nephew .
and from the looks of it , he might also be india &apos;s new replacement .
he seems great .
he is .
something you want to add ?
spit it out , jane .
i just ...
i feel a little silly saying this , but for a second there i thought that i was in the running for india &apos;s job .
you are .
where &apos;s jane ?
my sister , jane ?
yes , ben .
your sister jane .
i heard she went home early .
and right after i had that talk with her .
did you know about this ?
yes . i am aware of her departure .
what &apos;d she say ?
she said some things about cramps .
cramps . you know , lady stuff .
i &apos;m not that familiar with lady stuff , so i &apos;d really rather not discuss it .
hi , billy .
hello , miss shaw .
i heard jane went home .
she okay ?
she &apos;ll be fine .
just a cold .
- is that right ?
- mmm-hmm .
- a cold ?
- yeah .
all right , peace .
white chocolate half-caff latte .
your favorite .
and i picked up the tear sheets that you wanted this morning .
and i got you a reservation tomorrow night at per se .
i thought you said they were booked up for the next two months .
they are . i pulled some strings .
well done , jane .
and i thought you might like to take a look at these .
- what &apos;s this ?
- some sketches .
of mine .
just some new ideas for the accessories line .
i &apos;ll take a look .
you &apos;re still here .
yeah , gray said i should stick around a while and check out the place .
is that right ?
it is .
that &apos;s nice .
hello , jane .
can i ask you a question ?
- you just did .
- what ?
you asked if you could ask me something .
technically , that is a question .
sometimes you are way too british .
there &apos;s no such thing .
okay , come on , i &apos;m serious , jeremy .
at your service , miss quimby .
okay , so about this whole job offer thing .
do you really think it &apos;s a good idea ?
in what respect ?
well , in that i &apos;m an assistant .
and the closest i &apos;ve come to studying design is , i don &apos;t know , the endless hours i spent poring over theversastyle.com and fashion magazines every weekend .
this is a huge job .
why would gray trust me to handle something like this ?
because you can .
eli seems way more qualified and he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s nothing to worry about .
you have to run your own race , jane .
and you , you &apos;ve got what it takes .
you really think so ?
i know so .
plus , you deserve it .
i just really don &apos;t know if this is the right thing for me right now .
are you insane ?
i have a lot of stuff going on at home .
my best friend was away for a while and now he &apos;s back and ...
is this the same friend from the fashion show ?
isn &apos;t he the reason you turned me down ?
jeremy , we &apos;ve talked about this .
you &apos;re my mentor and my friend .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
no need to rub it in .
all i &apos;m saying is i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s the right time to leave him ...
to leave him behind .
that is why he was so upset .
i &apos;m not really following your chain of thought here .
oh , it &apos;s nothing .
thank you for all of your help .
one one thousand , two one thousand , three one thousand ...
- hey , you .
- what &apos;s going on with you ?
i was parched .
you &apos;re avoiding me .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m trying to keep things discreet .
between us .
you know ?
you &apos;re lying to me about jane .
billy said she has a cold .
- that was me !
- you said she had cramps .
i have to go .
go where ?
i have to go to the house to check on jane .
you &apos;ve got me really worried about these cold cramps .
that &apos;s a great idea . i &apos;m going with you .
and if jane isn &apos;t home sick in bed , that internship of hers is over .
- you have to get jane home !
- what happened ?
the collective brain power of you and me .
that &apos;s what happened .
you said cramps , didn &apos;t you ?
there &apos;s no time for blame .
yes . i said cramps .
you just couldn &apos;t stay out of it , could you ?
i told rita that i was going home to check on jane , and now she &apos;s coming with me .
so jane has to be home , in bed , sick , and fast .
i thought we were staying out of it .
can &apos;t you just call her ?
i &apos;ve called her like a dozen times .
it keeps going to voicemail .
ben , it &apos;s just the whole racing to save jane thing , it &apos;s not really my problem anymore .
look . i &apos;m not happy about this either , and i know you two are going through some sort of weird time right now , but she needs us . otherwise this whole fashion dream thing of hers is out the window .
she &apos;s my sister .
i can &apos;t bring myself to do that to her .
can you ?
i can &apos;t compete with this guy .
she &apos;s not going to hire her nephew .
you sure about that ?
look , i didn &apos;t go to school for design .
and i know my technique isn &apos;t exactly refined like the rest of you extremely talented people .
but , given the chance , i might be able to bring something new to the table here at donovan decker .
something different .
something fresh .
now i heard that you &apos;re already selling your own line , is that true ?
i do what i can .
mostly , right now i &apos;m just selling my stuff at pop-up shops or on the street .
honestly , the money i make barely covers materials , but i love it .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
yeah , i think so , too , carter .
are you listening to this ?
he &apos;s perfect .
he &apos;s charming and talented and good-looking
he &apos;s not that good-looking .
i &apos;m serious , jeremy .
there &apos;s no way i actually have a chance of getting this job .
not if i &apos;m up against a guy like that .
which i am .
please . it &apos;s a courtesy , jane .
a family obligation .
this is gray we &apos;re talking about .
she &apos;s not going to actually hire anyone she has to be nice to .
good point .
you are probably right .
yeah , i &apos;m always right .
you said we were leaving to check on jane 20 minutes ago .
and we are .
i just have to grade a few more of these puppies and we are on our way .
ten minutes , ben .
and then we &apos;re going .
and if i find out you are lying , we &apos;re gonna have a serious issue .
i &apos;m pleased to announce that i have found the perfect person to fill the vacancy left by india jourdain .
- it &apos;s you .
- what ?
i &apos;m certain of it .
this person has proven that they have exceptional creativity and style .
this person is destined to be a rising star here at donovan decker .
this person is ...
what , jane ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i just ...
i can &apos;t .
can &apos;t ?
i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;d like to take myself out of the running .
i &apos;m so sorry , gray .
i really am grateful .
i just ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready for this .
and i agree .
which is why i &apos;m pleased to introduce our newest designer ,
eli chandler .
billy , what are you doing here ?
- we need to get you home .
- what happened ?
what do you think happened ?
ben said cramps , didn &apos;t he ?
yeah . you know your brother doesn &apos;t think fast on his feet .
this is true .
and now miss shaw is on her way to your house to visit your sickbed .
what do you think &apos;s faster right now ?
5th or lex ?
we &apos;re gonna have to ...
you came for me .
and i &apos;m not gonna let that be for nothing .
we have to get you home . now .
jane , i &apos;m on my way to the house .
i &apos;ve stalled as long as i can and i just can &apos;t keep lying to rita .
your chariot awaits .
what was that for ?
no reason .
- oh , this is a shortcut .
- oh !
come on , janey !
oh , wait .
are you feeling okay ?
maybe we should just let her sleep a little bit .
wait a minute .
what is going on here ?
oh , hey guys .
i &apos;m feeling much ...
much better .
i just have a cold .
and cramps .
so i just needed to ...
double whammy .
hmm . well , feel better , okay , jane ?
thanks , miss shaw .
- i &apos;m sorry , ben .
- for what ?
for the whole manhunt thing .
coming down on you .
honestly , i feel terrible for questioning you , accusing you of lying .
i don &apos;t know what got into me .
i think you &apos;re just being the best guidance counselor in the history of guidance counselors , that &apos;s all .
that was far , far too close .
tell me about it .
oh , my gosh .
and how about me turning down that job that i wasn &apos;t even being offered ?
so embarrassing .
it wasn &apos;t so bad .
okay , it was pretty bad . i counted eight people cringing .
did you count me ?
i know you wanted that job .
honestly , i wasn &apos;t ready to leave being a teenager behind just yet .
and i am definitely not ready to leave you .
two months away .
it was a long time , billy .
i missed you .
i missed you , too , janey .
being away was terrible and lonely .
but knowing you &apos;d be here waiting was the only thing that got me through .
i have to ask you ...
you said , &quot; it &apos;s you , &quot; and i need to know if you meant ...
that it &apos;s you , janey .
you are my best friend .
the very best .
and i don &apos;t want that to ever change .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s most important , right ?
it is .
we must impress this harrods style director at any cost .
donovan is depending on us .
hello , losers .
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m the one you &apos;ve been waiting for .
where &apos;s jane ?
i can &apos;t wait to catch up .

i remember that day very clearly .
i was sitting right where you are sitting today .
i was ready to knock down the door , to kick some righteous ass .
just like you .
i just knew i was the smartest , the fastest , the best this institution had to offer .
and then ...
and then i stepped into the real world .
we are here today to honor the 50 newest agents of the federal bureau of investigation .
i &apos;m talking to you , ladies and gentlemen , because inside these walls , you all are the best of the best .
but i just want to take just a moment to think about what &apos;s going to happen outside these walls .
you all are walking off one battlefield in here and onto another battlefield out there .
the difference being , the battlefield out there is real , and the dangers are real .
ÿcomo estan , amigos ?
ah , sputnik .
everything you &apos;ve acquired of value in your short time on this earth , everything you are worth is locked inside of you , and that means , at this moment , you find yourself in the unique position you may never be in again :
you have nothing to lose .
let &apos;s cook it up !
i &apos;ll leave you with this :
whatever you think success means ,
i hope you &apos;ll stay open to the possibility that you &apos;ve got it all wrong ...
that you have absolutely no idea what life has got in store for you .
you will make mistakes . you are not perfect .
esta la buena .
you will fail .
and when the day comes and you figure it out ,
i hope you &apos;ll have the brains , the guts , and the straight up good luck to survive it .
you are now agents of the federal bureau of investigation .

- oh .
- yeah , it &apos;s brand-new .
it doesn &apos;t have a name yet .
- yeah .
- excuse me , sir ?
are you special agent mike warren with the fbl ?
this message was patched to you through the cockpit phone :
&quot; agent warren , wait under the baggage claim sign
&quot; in terminal &apos; c &apos; for your field training agent to arrive .
do not leave the baggage area under any circumstances . &quot;
uh manos arriba .
it means , &quot; hands up . &quot;
it &apos;s probably not on your lessons .
passengers arriving on flight 26 from dulles , virginia , your luggage will be available on baggage claim c.
this is the final boarding call for all passengers on flight number 122 .
mike warren , right ?
you wanna know how i knew that ?
uh , &apos; cause i was told to wait underneath this sign and i am ?
no , because only a guy who got a 1700 on his practicals and was told to wait under a sign is still gonna be waiting there two hours later .
where &apos;s agent briggs ?
who says i ain &apos;t briggs ?
well , you just said &quot; 1700 &quot; like you were impressed .
paul briggs got a higher score than i did , so from that , i would conclude that ... you didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m tuturro .
everybody calls me johnny .
dude , what &apos;s with the hand thing ?
oh , it improves gun control .
okay , yeah .
hey , what are you listening to ?
oh , it &apos;s spanish , for the language requirement .
it &apos;s a bitch , right ?
how you getting it ?
that &apos;s good .
dude , this place is a melting pot .
hey , ladies .
what did you say to them ?
i said , no matter what they say , i &apos;m gonna hold it against them .
but you surf ?
- you got shorts ?
- no .
- flips ? - no .
- sunscreen ?
- no .
god , your white ass is gonna burn .
all right , you gotta go shopping , okay ?
- okay .
- all right .
do the people around here know ?
- what , that we &apos;re feds ?
- yeah .
no , we tell &apos; em different things .
briggs tells people he &apos;s a tae bo instructor .
charlie says she &apos;s a trust fund kid .
yo , one chick i &apos;m dating thinks i &apos;m a lear jet pilot .
- she believes that ?
- yeah , she ... dude , you see this ?
lear jet key .
looks like a bike lock .
you are smarter than the chick i &apos;m dating .
tell me about briggs .
he &apos;s the best agent i ever seen .
that &apos;s what i hear , man .
this is it .
not bad , huh ?
hey , why do they call it &quot; graceland &quot; ?
when they seized it from this drug lord , he was apparently some hard-core elvis fan , and when they turned it into a flop house for us , the name just kinda stuck .
hey , be glad you &apos;re not moving in a lot of stuff , bro .
all right , so you , me , briggs , and charlie are fbl .
lauren and donnie are dea .
so is paige , but she &apos;s on a case for a couple days .
oh , and jakes .
jakes is customs .
it works , having three agencies in one house ?
we all start to blend together after a while .
oh , if you have civilians over , they stay down here , okay ?
nobody &apos;s allowed past those stairs without a badge .
so no local girls upstairs .
i know ...
i know it sucks .
yo , you know what this is ?
looks like a chore wheel .
you are smart .
we all take turns cleaning .
dishes , toilets , all that .
for now , wherever it says &quot; donnie , &quot; you write in your name .
- donnie &apos;s the dea guy who ...
- got shot ?
- yeah .
- yeah .
is he all right ?
he &apos;s alive .
that &apos;s about all we know right now .
they got him locked away in some safe house , so ... but good news is he doesn &apos;t have to clean the bathrooms tomorrow .
so mop &apos;s in the hall closet , brother .
come on , mikey .
okay , dude .
this is the phone room .
this is where you &apos;ll make all your uc calls .
that &apos;s lauren .
donnie was her partner .
that sucks .
donnie was under the gallardo cartel out of tijuana .
he was doing a needle drop .
what &apos;s that ?
well , they expect him to test the quality of the heroin by shooting up . right .
so he pretends to inject himself .
but what he &apos;s really doing is sticking the needle in a little rubber ball he &apos;s got tucked into his arm .
ball popped out , they shot him .
- damn .
- yeah .
be that way sometimes .
hey , briggs !
i got your new guy out here .
yeah , um ...

yo , find me later .
we &apos;ll grab something to eat .

right , south swell , don &apos;t get slammed on the pier .
uh , why is it important we do this ?
because when you catch that ride , better than sex . true .
this is about learning how to control your energy , okay ?

better than sex ?
- not in my world .
- sometimes .
all right .

i mean , a ga award and a director &apos;s award before he &apos;s 30 ?
i mean , he had more stats in his first year than his whole squad combined .
so you were expecting somebody a little more button-down , suit and tie-ish ?
yeah , something like that .
he was like that once .
a few years ago , something went down .
he took a leave of absence , came back all zenned out like that .
- you don &apos;t know what happened ?
- nope .
he never talks about it .
you &apos;re not curious ?
maybe he &apos;s just crazy .
totalmente loco , si .
oh , your spanish is coming along .
- ah , you like that ?
- it &apos;s all right .
the house is a tight fit .
you &apos;re gonna find out real fast there are no secrets at graceland .
- except for briggs .
- yeah , except for briggs .
that wave &apos;s about to get its ass kicked .
kill it , mike .
you almost got up .

because you can &apos;t take a crib sheet with you , okay ?
look , just keep it simple .
see , bad guys don &apos;t tend to ask a lotta questions because they don &apos;t want you asking a lotta questions .
you feel me ?
how do you and i know each other if he asks ?
if he asks , just say &quot; around . &quot;
we can make it a little interesting .
put him in the movie .
no , man !
why not ?
that contradicts everything i just said , john .
- so what ?
- um , what movie ?
- it &apos;s nothing . - i &apos;ll tell it !
all right , look .
the colima , right ... these guys are hard-core .
type of dudes that &apos;ll shoot you just to make sure that the gun works .
in the middle of this sting , i get some stupid award .
dude , top seizure agent of the year award .
cnn , in their infinite wisdom , they send a camera crew .
so for about a week ,
i &apos;ve got my face plastered all over the tv .
- not good .
- not good at all .
now , we &apos;re meeting with some of the top guys in the family .
this right here , my friends , is the best booger sugar in cali .
find none better .
i know you .
yeah , we both know richie .
tall guy , cockeyed .
they know they &apos;ve seen my face , but they can &apos;t place it .
now they &apos;re getting spooked .
the tv .
tell &apos; em what you said , briggs .
just tell &apos; em .
yeah , it &apos;s true .
you got me .
i don &apos;t brag about it , but i &apos;m an actor .
sometimes i play a cop in the movies .
- they believed that ?
- hell , no ! no .
so now we got gun barrels jammed under our chins , right ?
and i just start talking out of my ass .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve seen the trailer .
it &apos;s a movie about cops who are undercover as hookers .
no , no , no .
hey , straight up , man .
the dude is famous .
look , you know , i play a cop who goes under as a male hooker named shasta .
a hooker ?
yeah , yeah , and how the woman i marry turns out that her sister is a real hooker .
your wife &apos;s sister is a prostitute .
never said it was good movie .
you know , her pimp calls her ... calls her lowrider because , you know , you pull the strings on her panties , her ass starts like bouncing up and down
the movie ends with nine hookers hauling ass down sunset boulevard in full heels .
you know , it &apos;s called sunset bust .
so briggs did the craziest thing .
they &apos;re not buying any of this , dude .
like none of it .
tell him what you did .
may i show you something ?
well , basically , i know we &apos;re screwed if they search us , so i pull out my badge and toss it on the bed .
prop from the movie .
and they &apos;re looking at it , you know , real close .
it looks like something that came out of cracker jacks box .
- it &apos;s a low-budget film .
- yeah , right .
to this day , one of those guys still has an autographed picture of briggs hanging in his cell .
wait , wait , wait .
they went through with the buy ?
- yeah , they made the buy .
- we nailed &apos; em all .
hey , guys .
i gotta be in this movie .
- you sure you &apos;re ready , son ?
- come on , man .
if felix asks , you tell him that , uh , you play my brother-in-law .
but it ain &apos;t gonna matter , &apos; cause he ain &apos;t gonna ask .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
so i &apos;m married to the prostitute ?
yes , you &apos;re married to , uh ...
- lowrider .
- to lowrider .
- ha .
i hope he does ask now .
- yeah , me too .
all right , escobar .
i need you to put this on .
- is this plugged in ?
- transmits everything to us .
- ooh !

- not since the wire .
okay , gimme a level .
it &apos;s a pleasure doing business with you .
we &apos;re not trying to play to the balcony .
just talk normal .
pleasure doing business with you .
- i assume that &apos;s our bust line .
- yeah .
start hiring writers .
so i &apos;m in the middle of breakfast this morning , and i get a call from fbi ops asking why they haven &apos;t been informed that we &apos;re running a reverse on a vzakonye dealer .
imagine my surprise since i didn &apos;t know we had a vzakonye dealer .
we don &apos;t .
pulled him off the list a month ago .
- and we &apos;re doing this why ?
- that would be lauren &apos;s idea .
mike warren , gerry silvo .
i &apos;m your gs .
oh , it &apos;s a pleasure , sir .
let me know how long that lasts .
it &apos;s almost noon .
briggs taught you everything he knows yet ?
yes , sir .
wax on , wax off .
i assume that &apos;s an in-joke .
i don &apos;t like in-jokes .
- understood , sir .
- felix arroyo .
he &apos;s got a family , so he &apos;s not likely to rip you .
he &apos;s got his wife and kids in there .
he &apos;s not gonna start shooting .
this should be easy .
yeah , it should be .
mike , now remember , we &apos;re gonna be arresting you too , okay ?
so make it look good in case his buddies are watching .
- are you nervous ?
- yes , sir .
that &apos;s good .

- hey , levi .
- levi ?

- i don &apos;t think i like levi .
- too bad .
you don &apos;t get to choose your nickname , do you , johnny ?
- &quot; johnny &quot; is a nickname ?
- yep .
briggs gave it to me .
it &apos;s my character in the movie .
man , you put everyone in the movie , don &apos;t you ?
he begged .
check this .
tuturro and briggs were undercover with this biker gang .
tuturro figures if briggs can do it he can too .
damn right .
so he tells &apos; em that he plays this tough-guy killer .
without missing a beat , briggs tells him ,
&quot; yeah , the guy he shot was sitting on the toilet . &quot;
he tells them i shoot this dude when i catch him reading my dirty mags on the john .
mmhmm , two slugs .
one in the arm , one right in the chest .
couldn &apos;t even make me a good shot , could you ?
bikers started calling him johnny after that , and it stuck .
you know what , i like it .
here &apos;s to johnny .
i &apos;m glad you like it , levi .
to levi !
to levi .
thank you , officer .
i didn &apos;t know i could afford a lawyer with such a nice suit .
the police tell me you &apos;re a third striker , and i cannot bail you out .
stolen jeans .
it &apos;s a tough state .
we need assurance you will not talk to the feds .
i &apos;m not saying nothing .
just the same , your family will be staying with us until this is all over .
no , no , no , no .
i will do anything .
yes , you will .
start by telling the truth .
what is this crap with the jeans ?
it &apos;s just a side business , man .
we don &apos;t take care of you ?
who is this guy they arrested you with ?
it &apos;s my brother-in-law .
he &apos;s family .
- i &apos;m unpredictable ?
- hey !
what are we celebrating ?
what &apos;s up , dude ?
levi here popped his cherry today .
hey , levi !
- buy you a beer ?
- ah , no , i &apos;m good .
later then .
tell me a story , man .
a story ?
i got no stories .
well , let &apos;s think about that .
you just got yourself a shiny new nickname .
there &apos;s a gotta be a story in that .
all right , it was a reverse gone wrong , and i ended up with a truckload of knockoff jeans .
- knockoff jeans .
- a truckload .
that is a solid story .
yeah , you know what ?
it is a good story .
what about you ?
you &apos;re very protective of your juice .
oh , you sensing some deep psycho-babble in that ?
stayed in that anal phase too long ?
does not play well with others ?
wow , okay .
so you are an only child .
look , man , you caught me on a bad day .
but i bet you tuturro was up to mischief .
he &apos;s the one who handed you the juice .
am i right ?
i knew it .
i knew it .
and you didn &apos;t even rat out his little kale-eating scrawny ass .
respect , man .
let &apos;s start with the good news .
turns out that truck full of jeans was lifted off the port .
which makes it customs &apos; problem , not mine .
congratulations , jakes .
you are now the proud owner of 12,000 knockoff levi &apos;s ...
courtesy of your new bestest buddy mike .
- we met .
- aww . come on , levi .
bad news is ...
you just made bail .
so we &apos;re sure that they have felix &apos;s family .
felix panicked when the lawyer asked him about mike .
said he was his brother-in-law .
- he said what ?
- yeah .
but we got lucky .
felix does have a brother-in-law with a passing resemblance to mike .
by which i mean he &apos;s white .
frankie bout .
we gotta do something about your height .
he &apos;s got a scar above his left eye , and if it comes up , you &apos;ve lost a hell of a lot of weight .
other than that , he &apos;s a perfect match .
one minute .
mike , come on .
so how &apos;s your new job so far , huh ?
oh , well , it &apos;s great .
cleaned some dishes , learned how to surf .
so what exactly is gonna happen here ?
kidnapping a family is messy , mike .
all right , they &apos;re bailing you out because they want assurance that felix won &apos;t talk .
they think you &apos;re family .
they get you to do something illegal .
then if felix talks to us , they turn you in .
uh , we &apos;ve seen them do this before .
they &apos;re gonna ask you to kill someone ...
now all you gotta do is get a name , okay ?
you come back to us , that &apos;s it .
we got a guy over at the paper , he &apos;ll play ball with a homicide story , an obit .
they think the guy &apos;s dead , they let the family go .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
yeah , but if i don &apos;t , what happens to that family ?
all right .
all right , we gotta assume these russian pricks have the same intel we do .
you got exactly one hour to become this guy .
your name &apos;s frankie bout .
you got it , mike ?
- frankie bout .
- yeah .
your wife &apos;s name is katerina .
she &apos;s felix &apos;s wife &apos;s sister .
her name is irina .

mike just cut transmission .
- you saw the gun ?
- yeah , i see it right there .
he &apos;s back .
this is agent warren .
shots fired .
two men down .
where &apos;s the ambulance ?
agent briggs saved my life .
a morning raid at the russian vzakonye cartel by a joint federal task force resulted in several key arrests today .
the raid came after a firefight between federal agents and members of the cartel that left one cartel member injured ...
don &apos;t let it go to your head , mike .
no , ma &apos;am .
we did good .
hell , yeah , we did good !
the driver made a move to his weapon , and that &apos;s when agent briggs fired ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
and you both ordered the man in back to show his hands , and instead he drew his weapon ?
correct again .
agent warren ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
sounds like a clean shoot to me .
so are we good here ?
- briggs ?
- yeah , i &apos;m good .
warren , anything to add ?
no , ma &apos;am .
we &apos;re good .
- excellent work , both of you .
- thank you .
all right , man .
glasses up .
oh , man .
now look , as rookies , we all bought dope .
some of us even on the job , actually .
but today was one to remember .
- thank you .
- yup .
no , no . wait .
too much studying , not enough partying .
no , no , no .
back east , we don &apos;t dance with it .
we just drink it .
- oh , okay .
- oh , really ?
i wanna let you know no matter how much bitching silvo does , you did good today .
- thank you , sir .
- yeah .
that means a lot .
well , you know , mike , you are now an undercover agent for the bureau , okay ?
that means from this moment on , your lies are your life .
yes , sir .
you know , you &apos;re out on the street . you meet some fine little love &apos; n &apos; touch .
you better lie to her .
you know , your parents call you on a sunday afternoon ,
&quot; hey , mike , what you working on ? &quot;
you lie to &apos; em .
how do you do it though ?
i mean , how do you ... the lies .
how do you just keep from going crazy , you know ?
who says i haven &apos;t ?
no one , sir .
mind if i take this ?
- hey , it &apos;s your party .
- thanks .
- hey-yo !
- where are you going ?
- just gimme ...
- i told you the boy does not know how to party .
yo , mike !
agent campbell .
you were very right .
there &apos;s no way i could &apos;ve predicted this .
ah , you actually listened to my speech .
you know , i did .
agent briggs saved your life .
that true ?
yes , sir , he did .
i &apos;m calling to let you know that your assignment is to investigate briggs .
will what he did affect that ability ?
- no , sir .
- good .
keep that attitude , and you &apos;ll still make deputy director one day .
i appreciate that , sir .
keep your head down , mike .
yes , sir .
we &apos;re missing you over there .
you know , uh ,
i heard they kinda slammed you with this job , huh ?
yeah , they did .
d.c. one minute , the next you got sand in your shoes .
no idea why ?
no , sir .

tokuyawa , the daimyo o-take-san , his daughter the bonze karan , the temple servant
karan , the temple servant kin-be-araki , the teahouse keeper hanake , o-take-san &apos;s servant girl olaf j. anderson eva
tokuyawa , the daimyo travels from europe back to japan .
o-take-san , his daughter
&quot; father , i am so happy that you have returned ---- during your absence i had to suffer so much from the bonze ! &quot;
&quot; o-take-san , your father has brought this for you from the foreign lands . &quot;
the bonze .
karan , the temple servant .
&quot; noble lord , your servant is guarding the holy shrine from the trampling of foreign feet ! &quot;
&quot; may buddha bless your return ! &quot;
&quot; you have taken many foreign things to lippon again . &quot;
&quot; i noticed from the gifts for your daughter . &quot;
olaf j. anderson .
... so , in a couple of days o-take-san will become priestess in the &apos; holy forest &apos; ...
&quot; if my child wants to - i shall not force her ! &quot;
&quot; you have lost your faith in buddha in those foreign lands !
fear his wrath ! &quot;
&quot; that awful bonze persecutes me , because i have perceived his unclean purposes ... but i will pray to buddha myself ... and buddha will hear o-take-san ! &quot;
&quot; forgive your poor servant , who is not worthy to be buddha &apos;s priestess ... but who wants to sacrifice to the noble one her greatest and dearest treasures : her puppets . &quot;
&quot; buddha will make sure that you are punished . &quot;
three weeks later the festival of the &apos; falling leaves &apos; is celebrated .
&apos;may buddha bless you !
the mikade , his name be praised .
thanks you for your message about the traitorous daimyo , who , with foreign doctrines wants to incite the people against the sanctified person of the mikado .
the rebellious one will not escape his punishment ... &apos;
&quot; an envoy from the mikado awaits you , master ! &quot;
&quot; the noble mikado sends you this gift ...
you know what it means ... within 24 hours you must bid life farewell ! &quot;
&quot; a gift from our merciful lord , the mikado .
a sign of his mercy ! &quot;
&quot; go into the garden , for our guests are missing you ! &quot;
&quot; o-take-san has something to tell you ! &quot;
&quot; the daimyo is dead ! &quot;
&quot; as final sign of his devotion to the mikado , he gave him his life . &quot;
&quot; that is the palace of daimyo tokuyawa , he is a favorite of the mikado and his house is one of the most hospitable in japan . &quot;
&quot; your father was punished for your sins by buddha .
don &apos;t change your mind , buddha is strict , so serve him as priestess . &quot;
&quot; behind this wall lies the &apos; holy forest &apos; , where no european may enter ! &quot;
&quot; prepare yourself for it , o-take-san , in a couple of days your initiation as priestess will take place . &quot;
&quot; how did you get here , stranger ?
don &apos;t you know our strict laws ? &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to fall into the hands of guards you should leave quickly ! &quot;
&quot; come tomorrow at the same hour ... &quot;
&quot; o-take-san would be a very good geisha for the keeper of the teahouse . &quot;
&quot; .... a normal garden .... &quot;
&quot; i cannot follow you , for soon i will be consecrated as buddha &apos;s priestess . &quot;
&quot; ... in the evening &quot; .
&quot; come quickly , o-take-san , i want free you , but promise me you will be quit ! &quot;
&quot; olaf , you changed a lot .
come with us to the teahouse ! &quot;
&quot; a new geisha ! &quot;
&quot; if you pay well , i will bring you the most beautiful geisha in nagasaki . &quot;
&quot; noble chief , you can only keep this geisha if , according to the laws of the yoshiwara , you marry her for 999 days .
you have , however , the right to divorce her , whenever you want . &quot;
&quot; i am willing . &quot;
the next morning .
&quot; karan ! &quot;
&quot; where is o-take-san ? &quot;
&quot; bring me o-take-san , or i .. &quot;
some time later .
&quot; i can &apos;t approve the marriage of olaf anderson with that japanese girl , for it won &apos;t be long before we return home ! &quot;
&quot; holy priest , after much effort i &apos;ve found o-take-san .
she is married to a foreign marine officer and lives in the teahouse on the hill . &quot;
&quot; be cursed , an unfaithful one . &quot;
the weeks later .
&quot; i went to collect my inheritance ... &quot;
&quot; this illustrates the three virtues of japanese girls !
they may hear nothing , speak nothing and see nothing . &quot;
&quot; this is the sword with which my father killed himself , by order of the mikado ! &quot;
&quot; you shouldn &apos;t put so much faith in your happiness , o-take-san ... it could change quickly ! &quot;
&quot; olaf will never leave me .. ! &quot;
&quot; my dear olaf , it is not nice of you , to make your little wife sad . &quot;
&quot; that little o-take-san seems to really love you ! &quot;
... and when the honeymoon was over ...
&quot; greetings o-take-san , don &apos;t be sad ...
i am travelling back to europe , but ...
i will return ! &quot;
&quot; come back swiftly olaf ...
you do know ... that you ... must come back ! &quot;
the memories of the land where the peaches grow .
... some little geisha somewhere ...
&quot; little olav , repeat after me :
great buddha , grant me my wish and make o-take-san happy again ! &quot;
lord matahari .
&quot; in four weeks it will be four years ago , that o-take-san &apos;s husband left her .
according to our laws , she will be free again then , and must return to the yoshiwara ! &quot;
&quot; ... and if she has no money to buy herself free ! &quot; ...
&quot; i want to know immediately where o-take-san lives ! &quot;
dear olaf ! you probably still remember that little geisha , who you married years ago .
the poor creature has taken the affair very seriously , and has been waiting all these years with her child in tender longing for you ...
&quot; o-take-san lives with the keeper of the teahouse , kin-be-araki ! &quot;
&quot; the bonze wants you to ask her for the rent for the room ... if o-take-san cannot pay ... she must remain in your teahouse ! &quot;
&quot; that stranger paid for three years , o-take-san has been living here with me for four years now and if does not pay the rent , she must leave this house immediately . &quot;
&quot; i have nothing , but my husband , olaf jens anderson , will be back soon , and then you will certainly get the money ! &quot;
&quot; in my department i will not allow the oppression of the poor ! &quot;
&quot; you won &apos;t be bothered by that landlord again , take this money ! &quot;
&quot; o-take-san is beautiful ... and i don &apos;t want her to lack anything ! &quot;
&quot; today i got the order to set sail for japan . would you like to come along ? &quot;
... and when the peach trees were in bloom again ...
&quot; o-take-san , an emissary from lord matahari awaits you ! &quot;
&quot; i love you , o-take-san , and if you want ... &quot;
&quot; o-take-san , would be my wife ? &quot;
&quot; i do not want your wealth .
i am the wife of olaf anderson .
i &apos;d rather die than be unfaithful to him ! &quot;
&quot; you are mistaken , o-take-san ...
olaf anderson is not your husband and your mariage ... &quot;
&quot; i won &apos;t have you insult my husband , he &apos;ll return soon to me and his child ! &quot;
&quot; a european ship has entered the harbor ...
i can feel that ... it &apos;s olaf ! &quot;
&quot; come , hanake , let us decorate the house with flowers for the reception ! &quot;
after a night of waiting awake in vain ...
&quot; i &apos;m going to the consulate to ask for him ! &quot;
&quot; o-take-san &apos;s time is up .
she must go back to the yoshiwara .
the child will be entrusted to the state . &quot;
&quot; master , help !
they want to steal o-take-san &apos;s child ! &quot;
&quot; olaf anderson , help for godsake !
they are trying to steal your child ! &quot;
&quot; ... now that she is free again , she must return to the &apos; holy forest &apos; ! &quot;
&quot; go away !
you weren &apos;t concerned about buddha &apos;s sacred service .
you just wanted to have your revenge ! &quot;
&quot; my gratitude for your protection , lord .
but i cannot become your wife ...
i am the wife of olaf anderson ! &quot;
&quot; come , it is at least your duty to help that poor o-take-san ! &quot;
&quot; he is coming , o-take-san !
he is coming ! &quot;
&quot; why doesn &apos;t he come himself ...
i know ... he has forgotten me ... it was your will ! &quot;
&quot; he can come collect the child himself , tell him that ! &quot;
&quot; go inside and get your child ! &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s better to die with honour than to live in shame ! &quot;
&quot; where is o-take-san ? &quot;
&quot; o-take-san is dead ! &quot;

a dangerous proposal
comedy in four acts based on the short story by the same title
published by scandia-film
at the time when aslaug became a grown-up girl , there was no much rest at night to be had at huseby .
… as the most handsome boys in the village both wrangled and fought night after night .
the nights before sunday were the worst .
thormund , the wealthiest farmer in the village - hjalmar peters
ola , his son - kurt welin
courage , my boy !
i have talked to knut huseby , and you will receive a warm welcome .
knut huseby - theodor blich
aslaug . knut huseby &apos;s daughter - gull cronvall
you don &apos;t seem to succeed much better then the rest of us in pleasing the huseby wolf
sigurd and oivind , huseby &apos;s sons - hugo tranberg and gosta cederlund
since i &apos;ve been given a daughter , i &apos;m obliged to protect her , boys
you are so right , father .
whoever makes his way here will be saluted by me
should we baptize him ?
there you go !
i think you dampened his burning desire .
tore naesset was only a smallholder &apos;s son , but was nevertheless reputed ... to be the one who most frequently visited the huseby farmer &apos;s daughter .
darling , come what may , tomorrow i will speak with your father .
tomorrow i will follow you to huseby and propose in knut &apos;s presence .
on sunday , after tore had escorted his mother home from church ... he set out to address huseby , just like he had promised aslaug . tore &apos;s mother - hilda castegren
no , no , my lad , don &apos;t even think of such haughtiness .
you , a poor smallholder &apos;s son , could never get the daughter at huseby .
i most certainly can , little mum .
it &apos;s plain to see that these two suit each other well .
although the girl is a little shy , of course .
is your father at home ?
you , knut huseby , are a wealthy man , and i myself am no church mouse .
you have many children , and i only have this one son .
what if you gave my son your daughter &apos;s hand in marriage ?
it seems a fair offer , but in this case my daughter will have to make her own decision .
go out and find aslaug , sigurd .
father wants a word with you , aslaug , and he won &apos;t be pleased to know ... that you stand here wasting time with the smallholder boy from nesset , ... when a bloke like ola thormundsen has come to propose to you .
it so happens that aslaug and i have loved each other for a long time .
i have come here to ask for her hand .
if i can &apos;t have tore , i will not spend another happy day in this world
as yet , there is no tradition here on huseby for farmers &apos; daughters ... to share the marriage bed with smallholders &apos; sons .
nevertheless , that day is likely to arrive .
the end of act 1
a few days later .
aslaug brought the cattle to the summer pasture .
the next saturday night .
only one road led to the huseby summer farm , and it passed right by the main farm .
would you believe that boy !
he seems to be heading for the mountain farm !
god &apos;s peace on the summer farm !
god &apos;s peace to you too .
it &apos;s just not right that this smallholder stud should be allowed up at the huseby summer farm .
well , if no one else can keep him at bay ... i guess me and my sons should give it a try .
i may still possess some talent in that direction .
come on , boy , let &apos;s have a bout !
enough for today , fiddler !
come back soon , and i &apos;ll give you some more !
don &apos;t forget your fiddle when you come to our wedding .
a lazybone like you will have to accept whatever comes his way .
while aslaug faithfully yearned , tore approached the huseby farm .
if next saturday you manage to slip past the huseby wolf and his cubs , the girl will be yours .
the end of act 2
a few days passed .
since tore visit to the farm , there had been no news from the valley .
what do you want , my lad ?
how do you do up here , aslaug ?
you are probably a bit lonely now that nesset cannot come here anymore ?
yes , he got what he deserve .
we fixed him up so well last saturday night , ... that he &apos;s probably lost all desire to go courting again at the huseby mountain farm .
come next saturday .
tore was fit again , although not in such high spirits as he used to be .
if next saturday you manage to slip past the huseby wolf and his cubs , the girl will be yours .
in the worst case , i &apos;ll get a good beating !
we &apos;re just here to make sure that the smallholder boy from nesset stays away from the summer farm tonight .
yes , we would like to join you .
position yourselves two at every hill .
if he approaches , whistle !
i bet ola would love to go to the mountain farm himself tonight .
the two of us as well .
the girl will finally have to give up ... because the engagement will be broken off tonight .
the boys will stand guard down here .
the end of act 3
it was on a saturday evening . i had been awaiting you .
you promised me to come , but your promise proved untrue .
where could you find a rose where no rose ever grows ?
where can true love be found if your sweetheart lets you down ?
god &apos;s peace on the mountain farm !
god &apos;s peace to you too !
that fellow is worth having .
the girl shall be his .
the shimmering summer air hangs over hardangerfjord .
against the sky in bluish hue the mighty mountains loom .

die spinnen ( the spiders ) was fritz lang &apos;s third feature film ... and the first to establish his reputation as one of germany &apos;s ... foremost silent directors .
lang &apos;s work on the spiders ... prevented him from directing the expressionist classic ...
the cabinet of dr. caligari , a film that had been assigned to him ... by producer erich pommer .
the credits of the spiders , however , include several names ... famous by caligari , such as set designer hermann warm and ... actress lil dagover .
filmed in 1919 , the spiders was made ... in two parts designed to be shown on two different theatre dates .
lang &apos;s plans to complete the serial story with a third ... and fourth part to be titles the secret of the sphinx and for asia &apos;s imperial crown ... were unfortunately never realized .
the film &apos;s obsession with diabolical evil directed by ... a powerful but unseen force is a foreshadowing ... of the dr. mabuse films made by lang three years later ...
part of a series of adventure films in exotic locations ... popular in germany at the time , the spiders was a ... boxoffice success and made decla the leading german studio .

&quot; each of you knows the great importance of a message in a bottle ...
it is the last attempt of shipwrecked sailors to send a message . &quot;
&quot; today as i headed toward shore aboard my yacht ... &quot;
&quot; i hurried home to open the bottle . &quot;
to whomever finds this :
please notify harvard university ...
cambridge massachusetts , immediately that i was taken ... prisoner here near the 75th longitude by descendants of the incas ... who by tradition still faithfully offer human sacrifice to the sun .
unbelievable treasures lie buried below the ruins of their temples ... which are probably inherited from their old king ...
beneath the so-colled &quot; holy sea &quot; extends a gold mine , which appears to be inexhaustible .
today i escaped my torturers and made it to the coast ...
in the name of god , help me .

&quot; i found the point on a map ... &quot;
&quot; and wired harvard university immediately . &quot;
&quot; as proof that this mystery really exists . i have the reply . &quot;
professor johnson has been missing ... for six months from peru expedition .
&quot; consequently , i will not be in tomorrow &apos;s race for the golden trophy ... of san francisco .

the spiders &apos; expedition .
&quot; it &apos;s not enough that we have kay hoog opposing us for the gold treasure ... now he also has the key to our biggest secret , the diamond ship . &quot;

&quot; we will make a human sacrifice , so that the race of the incas ... will again become great and renew its ancient splendor . &quot;
&quot; flee from here .

death waits for you here . &quot;
&quot; flee , otherwise you are lost !
no white man has ever left this valley alive . &quot;

a heart attack .
experiment successful .
in hypnotic trance , yoghi saw stone ... ... in possession of diamond magnate terry london ... ... whose ancestors stole the holy stone generations ago ... ... four-finger john will make all preparations .
dear mr. hoog :
here are the decoded contents of the secret document ... ... about four hundred years ago , the ming dynasty in china has ... ... in possession a diamond , which because of its peculiar shape resembled the head of buddha .
this stone was stolen and , so the story goes , asia will free ... ... itself from foreign tyranny when a princess brings this stone back to asia .
&quot; change course ... head for england ! &quot;
john terry , the diamond magnate , and his daughter ellen .
&quot; i must leave at once on important business . &quot;
mr. terry returns .
the spiders have kidnapped your daughter .
as ransom ... ... we demand the buddha-head diamond .
you will hear from us .
the next day .
speclal edltion !
5,000 pounds reward !
&quot; the storm bird left the harbor tonight for an unknown destination . &quot;
on board of storm bird .
&quot; i don &apos;t know what diamond you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
&quot; it seems that the solution can only be found through john terry himself . &quot;
the spiders have kidnapped your daughter .
as ransom ... ... we demand the buddha-head diamond .
you will hear from us .
&quot; i don &apos;t know what they want from me .
i have never owned such a stone . &quot;
&quot; and yet the secret must lie with you .
the spiders do nothing that isn &apos;t ... ... thought out .
isn &apos;t anything known in your family about such a diamond ? &quot;
&quot; perhaps one of your ancestors ? &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s the founder of our family fortune ... ... one of the most famous pirate captains of the sixteenth century . &quot;
&quot; the logbook of the sea witch . &quot;
&quot; i vaguely remember reading something in the captain &apos;s logbook that ... ... might have been a reference to the diamond shaped like a buddha . &quot;
we went ashore on the coast of the falkland islands and found ... ... our secret cache in the caves , as we had left it two years ago .
&quot; a few pages in the logbook are missing here .
what happened after distributing the loot ... ... i don &apos;t know .
something terrible must have happened , because the logbook says only ... &quot;
i was the only one who could save himself .
&quot; what happened ... what catastrophe befell the unlucky sailors ... ... there is nothing in the logbook .
shortly thereafter , the captain ... ... died in a battle , and his successor brought the logbook and the picture to the family . &quot;
many have tried to discover the secret of the hiding place ... ... but no one has succeeded .
&quot; an old map of the falkland islands . &quot;
&quot; four-finger john ! &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s see if we can find any clues in his room to the whereabouts of ellen . &quot;
&quot; if you tell us exactly what has happened to ellen terry , we will ... ... release you and give you the reward .
&quot; ellen terry was taken on board the storm bird ... ... and is sailed immediately .
i don &apos;t know its destination . &quot;
&quot; we will keep you here for 48 hours , to prevent sabotage of our plans ... ... then you are free . &quot;
&quot; i will try to find the stone ... the fate of your daughter depends on it ... ... i will succeed or perish . &quot;
&quot; stone possibly on falkland islands ... ... kay hoog on his way to find the diamond . &quot;
&quot; change the course of the storm bird at once ! &quot;
&quot; i will force ellen terry under my will and make her the princess ... ... who will free asia from all foreign tyranny . &quot;
&quot; when she wears the imperial crown , all asia will lie at our feet . &quot;
&quot; a footprint ! &quot;
the treasure cavern .
&quot; give me the buddha-head diamond ! &quot;
&quot; he has to have the stone .
i saw it in his hand . &quot;
&quot; hunger and thirst will make you talk . &quot;
the poisonous crater .
during the night , deadly fumes rose from the crater .
weeks later , back in london .
&quot; i was the only one who could save himself , and here is the stone . &quot;
&quot; shortly before you arrived , i received a call from ... ... the pinkerton detective agency . they think they have found a clue to my daughter .
&quot; an elderly gentlemen has registered at the royal hotel with a young woman ... ... although she is supposedly his daughter , she fits the photo of the missing girl . &quot;
&quot; i have been instructed to ask you to come along and identify the girl . &quot;
&quot; we must be careful not to arouse suspicion ... ... you can observe their room from here . &quot;
&quot; lio sha is dead . &quot;
&quot; the stone is lost forever . &quot;
&quot; no one must know .
for some time i have been followed by indian spies ... ... the asian committee suspects me of being a double agent ... ... since i haven &apos;t been able to produce the stone as i had promised . &quot;
&quot; there is only one way to avoid disaster .
have a diamond shop cut ... ... a stone that is just like the original .
that &apos;s the only way to fool them . &quot;
&quot; go to amsterdam today .
spare no expense .
it &apos;s our only chance . &quot;
&quot; ellen terry is under my spell .
she is sleeping now . &quot;
&quot; you have betrayed asia ... ... you and the woman who was going to usurp the imperial crown ... you must die ! &quot;
&quot; your daughter appears to have been under a hypnotic spell ... ... but she &apos;s awake now , and knows nothing of the past events . &quot;
the phantom carriage
a tale told in livlng plctures under the directlon of victor sjöström
once there was a poor salvation army sister at death &apos;s door .
she was stricken with galloplng consumptlon , and she had only held out for the space of a year .
when there was no hope left she had gone home to her mother .
waiting at the foot of her bed was another salvation army sister who had once worked alongside the sick girl .
&quot; don &apos;t fret over those poor souls now , sister edit . &quot;
&quot; you have done enough for them . &quot;
&quot; send for david holm ! &quot;
&quot; please don &apos;t !
my daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life . &quot;
&quot; let me have her to myself now that she ls dylng . &quot;
&quot; slster maria , why don &apos;t you do as i ask ?
send for david holm ! &quot;
&quot; i shall go fetch hlm at once . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t be serious , asklng david holm to attend a death bed ? &quot;
&quot; i haven &apos;t been able to find him , but gustavsson is looking too . &quot;
&quot; he will bring him here if that is at all possible . &quot;
&quot; poor mrs holm poor mrs holm &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll take her back home . &quot; &quot; it wouldn &apos;t do for her husband to see her should he come . &quot;
the evenlng on which these events took place was not an ordinary one .
it was new year &apos;s eve .
&quot; well , we will certainly know when it &apos;s time to toast the new year ! &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a spooky place to await midnight , here among the dead . &quot;
&quot; you gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts , i hope ? &quot;
&quot; then i &apos;d like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour . &quot;
&quot; i once had a pal called georges , who was generally a jolly fellow . &quot;
&quot; he came of a good family , and had studied hard at uppsala university , so he knew a bit more than the rest of us . &quot;
&quot; but a change would come over hlm on new year &apos;s eve . &quot;
&quot; remember that it &apos;s new year &apos;s eve , the last day of the year ! &quot;
&quot; whoever dies on this eve must drive the cart of death . &quot;
&quot; there is an old , old cart ... &quot;
no ordinary driver holds the reigns . &quot;
&quot; he is in the service of a strict master named death . &quot;
&quot; for him , a single night is as long as 100 years on earth . &quot;
&quot; night and day he must carry out his master &apos;s business . &quot;
end of part i
the phantom carriage part ll
&quot; wherever he goes , he is greeted with sorrow and despair . &quot;
&quot; there is no escape he must perform his sorry duty . &quot;
&quot; although the horse and cart remain the same , the driver will vary . &quot;
&quot; the last soul to die each year , the one who gives up the ghost at the stroke of midnight , is destined to be death &apos;s driver during the coming year . &quot;
&quot; now you know why i &apos;m afraid of something fatal happening on new year &apos;s eve . &quot;
&quot; and the odd thing is , you see , that georges apparently died last new year &apos;s eve . &quot;
&quot; why hasn &apos;t gustavsson arrived with david holm ? &quot;
&quot; come with me , david holm &quot;
&quot; sister edit is dying and she has asked for you . &quot;
&quot; lf sister edit wants to see you , you must go at once ! &quot;
&quot; david , i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s you !
you are meant to relieve me ! &quot;
&quot; you ought to lift me up ln your cart and take me to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; no living soul rides ln this cart . &quot;
&quot; by the time i arrive it is too late for a doctor . &quot;
&quot; you know well enough that i am no longer alive . &quot;
&quot; but , worst of all , you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime . &quot;
&quot; david , do you think i &apos;m unaware that it is my fault you have met such an end ? &quot;
&quot; lf you hadn &apos;t fallen in with me you would have led a good life with your wife , children and brother . &quot;
&quot; by tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behaviour . &quot;
&quot; but before you leave , a harsher punishment awaits you . &quot;
&quot; behold , your brother . &quot;
&quot; while you were here he killed a man while intoxicated , and now a long prison term awaits . &quot;
&quot; but we feel that you ought to serve the sentence instead , since you and you alone led him astray , and made him a killer . &quot;
&quot; does this not make you turn from your wicked ways , david holm ? &quot;
&quot; yes , for only now do i realise how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one . &quot;
&quot; what about your wife and children ? &quot;
&quot; i know how miserable they felt , but i will turn over a new leaf . &quot;
end of part ll
the phantom carriage part ill
&quot; no , she is not ill . &quot; &quot; she was well enough the other day , when she left . &quot;
&quot; and here i was thinklng i would come home to her with such joy ! &quot;
&quot; lf she had gone openly ,
i would have understood , but to slink off like that , to let me come home to an empty house , that was heartless ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll wipe those smiles off your faces . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll find her , and i &apos;ll teach her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core , like mine has ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife , during which your feelings of hatred and revenge waxed stronger . &quot;
&quot; i will take you to a time a year ago , to last new year &apos;s eve , when you came here , bringing such misfortune in your wake . &quot;
&quot; a salvation army station had been set up here in town . &quot;
&quot; and it was ready for use on new year &apos;s eve . &quot;
&quot; keep your food ! i only want to sleep . &quot;
&quot; leave it be !
it may be full of germs ! &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t have the sterilislng oven going yet . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t you realise , maria , how it pleases me to help the first guest god sent us ? &quot;
&quot; please , go to bed .
it &apos;s been a busy day . &quot;
&quot; let me attend to thls . &quot;
&quot; dear jesus , let our first guest be blessed with a happy year . &quot;
all nlght long she bent over the coat , never giving thought to the germs she had inhaled . &quot;
&quot; by the time she went to bed the chill of winter had thoroughly penetrated the room . &quot;
&quot; did you mend my coat ? &quot;
&quot; would you mind fetching the person who did this ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a shame you went to all that trouble , miss , but i &apos;m used to having it like this . &quot;
&quot; before you leave , i &apos;d like to ask you to visit me next new year &apos;s eve . &quot;
&quot; you see , i prayed that our first guest would have a good year . &quot;
&quot; and i wanted to find out if my prayers were answered . &quot;
&quot; oh , i &apos;ll be here . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ll come to show you god didn &apos;t give a fig for you or your twaddle . &quot;
&quot; the time has come to honour that promise before you take over here . &quot;
&quot; from you she contracted the disease that ends her life , and now she awaits your visit . &quot;
&quot; you have possessed all that is most wonderful , but you have lost it ! &quot;
&quot; you cannot avold the torment or remorse , just as you cannot escape taking over as death &apos;s driver for a year . &quot;
&quot; captive , take leave of thy prison ! &quot;
&quot; ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight , thou wilt relieve me of my office . &quot;
&quot; for a year thou wilt reap souls . &quot;

&quot; it is death , but too soon . &quot;
&quot; you see that i &apos;m not afraid of you . &quot;
&quot; i will gladly heed your summons , but grant me a day &apos;s grace , for there is someone i must talk sense into . &quot;
&quot; you do not know what terrible misfortune i have caused . &quot;
&quot; i cannot approach the lord before i have put it right . &quot;
&quot; i must tell you that the person i &apos;m waitlng for is the man i love .
&quot; do you understand ?
the man i love ! &quot;
&quot; i would grant you grace if it would avail you , but you have no power over this man . &quot;
&quot; you have tried to make him mend his ways , believing he was good , but your hopes have been dashed time and time again . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re the one who enticed him away from his home and his work ! &quot;
&quot; you made him the drunkard he is ! &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t let yourself be dragged under ! &quot;

&quot; run along and be saved , and upon my soul i &apos;ll come and watch you ! &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s the use of making such a fuss ? &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m a consumptive , but i cough into people &apos;s faces in the hope of finlshlng them off . &quot;
&quot; why should they be better than us ? &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s merely amusing hlmself .
he &apos;s not as wicked as he pretends to be . &quot;
&quot; how can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man ? &quot;
&quot; you needn &apos;t worry about that .

&quot; no , you mustn &apos;t do that ! &quot;

&quot; however tempting that maybe , i still can &apos;t stay . &quot;

&quot; who ls this person you seek ? &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll know that when i find the person in question &quot;
&quot; i am the one david holm is looking for . &quot;
&quot; i am his wife . &quot;
&quot; i couldn &apos;t endure the life he led . &quot;
&quot; i deserted him , took my children and crept away in secret . &quot;
&quot; i moved to this town for it was so far from our old home , that i never expected him to come looking for me here . &quot;
&quot; you must take him back !
it &apos;s his only hope ! &quot;
&quot; i didn &apos;t mean that you must make up your mind on the spot , but promise me to listen to your heart , and we can talk again . &quot;

&quot; yes , this david holm has been her undoing . &quot;

&quot; are you crying , david ? &quot;
&quot; no one believes i want to reform . &quot;
&quot; i want to be good , but no one believes me. ls it any wonder i cry ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to believe , david . &quot;
&quot; but i do believe you .
your tears convinced me . &quot;

whoever dies on this eve must drive death &apos;s carriage . ”
there is an old , old carriage ... ”
it is no ordinary driver who holds the reins , for he &apos;s in the service of a strict master named death .
for him , a single night is as long as 100 years on earth .
night and day he must carry out his master &apos;s business .
end of part 1
the phantom carrlage part 2
wherever he goes , he &apos;s greeted with sorrow and despair . ”
there is no escape . he must perform his forlorn duty . ”
though horse and carriage are always the same , the driver is not . ”
the last soul to die each year- the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight- is destined to be death &apos;s driver for the following year .
now you know why i &apos;m afraid of something fatal happening to me on new year &apos;s eve .
and the odd thing is , you see , that georges apparently died last new year &apos;s eve .
why hasn &apos;t gustavsson arrived with david holm ? ”
come with me , david holm !
sister edit is dying , and she has asked for you .
if sister edit wants to see you , you must go to her at once ! ”
david , i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s you !
it is you who is to relieve me ! ”
you should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can . ”
no living soul rides in that carriage .
by the time i arrive , it &apos;s too late for a doctor .
you know full well that i am no longer among the living . ”
but worst of all , you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime .
david , do you think i &apos;m unaware that it &apos;s my fault you &apos;ve met such an end &apos; ?
if you hadn &apos;t fallen in with me , you &apos;d have led a good life with your wife , children , and brother .
by tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior .
but before you leave , a harsher punishment awaits you .
behold your brother .
while you were here , he killed a man while intoxicated , and now a long prison term awaits .
but we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place , since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer .
does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways , david holm ? ”
only now do i realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one .
what about your wife and children ? ”
now i know how miserable they &apos;ve been , but i will turn over a new leaf .
they need never despair of me again .
end of part 2
the phantom carrlage part 3
no , she &apos;s not ill . she was well enough the other day when she left .
and here i thought i &apos;d come home to her with such joy ! ”
if she had gone openly , i would have understood .
but to slink off like that , to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless !
i &apos;ll wipe those smiles off your faces .
i &apos;ll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core , like mine has now !
i &apos;ll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife , during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger .
i will take you to a time a year ago , to last new year &apos;s eve , when you came to this town , bringing such misfortune in your wake .
a salvation army station had been set up here in town , and it was ready for use on new year &apos;s eve .
keep your food ! i just want to sleep . ”
leave it alone !
it may be full of germs , and our sterilizing oven isn &apos;t working yet .
don &apos;t you realize , maria , how happy i am to help the first guest god has sent us ?
please go to bed .
it &apos;s been a busy day .
let me attend to this .
dear jesus , let our first guest be blessed with a happy year . ”
all night long she bent over the coat , never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled .
by the time she went to bed , the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room .
was it you who mended my coat &apos; ? ”
would you mind calling the person who did this ? ”
it &apos;s a shame you went to all that trouble , miss , but i &apos;m used to having it like this .
before you leave , i &apos;d like to ask you to visit me again next new year &apos;s eve . ”
you see , i prayed that our first guest would have a good year , and i &apos;d like to know if my prayer was answered .
oh , i &apos;ll be here .
i &apos;ll come show you god didn &apos;t give a fig for you or your twaddle .
the time has come to honor that promise before you take over here .
from you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed , and now she awaits your visit .
you possessed all that is most wonderful , but you lost it !
you cannot avoid the torment of remorse , just as you cannot escape taking over as death &apos;s driver for a year .
&quot; captive , come forth from thy prison !
ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight , thou wilt relieve me of my office .
for a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm .
end of part 3
the phantom carrlage part 4
it is death , but he has come too soon . ”
you see that i &apos;m not afraid of you .
i will gladly heed your summons , but grant me a day &apos;s reprieve , for there is someone i must talk sense into .
you do not know what terrible misfortune i have caused .
i cannot approach the lord until i have set it right .
the person i &apos;m waiting for is the man i love .
do you understand ?
the man i love !
i would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you . but you have no power over this man !
believing he was good , you &apos;ve tried to make him mend his ways , but your hopes have been dashed time and time again .
it was you who enticed him away from his home and work !
you made him the drunkard he is !
don &apos;t let yourself be dragged under ! ”
salvatlon army rally
run along and be saved , and i &apos;ll be sure to come watch ! ”
why turn away so carefully ?
i &apos;m a consumptive myself , but i cough in people &apos;s faces in hopes of finishing them off .
why should they be better off than us ?
he &apos;s merely amusing himself .
he &apos;s not as wicked as he pretends to be . ”
how can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man &apos; ? ”
you needn &apos;t worry about that .
i &apos;ll be leaving town in a few days . ”
no , you mustn &apos;t do that ! ”
i would rather you stayed so i may challenge you again . ”
tempting as that may be , i still can &apos;t stay . ”
you see , little missy , i &apos;m on a journey throughout sweden in search of someone i must find at all costs .
who is this person you seek ? ”
you &apos;ll know that when i find the person in question ! ”
i am the one david holm is looking for . ”
i am his wife . ”
i couldn &apos;t endure the life he was leading .
i deserted him . i took my children and crept away in secret .
i moved to this town , for it was so far from our old home that i never expected him to come looking for me here .
you must take him back ! it &apos;s his only hope ! ”
„ i didn &apos;t mean you must make up your mind on the spot . only promise you &apos;ll listen to your heart , and let us talk again later .
she had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world .
just come with me !
a surprise awaits that will make you happy .
end of part 4
the phantom carrlage part 5
she hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns . and she may well have succeeded had it not been for ...
the doctor says it &apos;s pneumonia .
and her resistance is poor , for she &apos;s been in ill health since last new year &apos;s eve .
yes , that david holm has been her undoing .
she worries so about the situation between him and his wife , but she mustn &apos;t know the truth .
you might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children ! ”
it wasn &apos;t so easy to run away this time ! ”
haven &apos;t you had your fill of revenge , david &apos; ? ”
if only i hadn &apos;t brought them together again .
his sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me .
you must grant me a reprieve !
i cannot die yet !
i must see him turn over a new leaf !
just spare me a few minutes !
you know i love him !
i &apos;ve never loved him as i do today . ”
captive , ye of loving head , come forth from thy prison ! ”
come along .
we have no business here .
those who are to receive her will arrive shortly .
you know , david , if i could send a message to mankind ,
i would like to send them a new year &apos;s greeting .
„ i would like them to dwell on a single new year &apos;s prayer :
&apos;lord , please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped . &apos;
why are we here ?
surely no one here is going to die ! ”
no , i can &apos;t go on !
i can &apos;t go on ! ”
i &apos;m sorry , but i must go away , and i cannot leave them behind . ”
please don &apos;t be angry with me. it &apos;s not my fault . ”
this will do , david .
it will suffice for the children and myself .
&quot; yes , david , i see what &apos;s coming .
i &apos;m obliged to watch .
i will not shirk my duty .
you mustn &apos;t let this happen !
this mustn &apos;t come to pass !
don &apos;t let those poor , innocent creatures die !
„ i have no power over the living .
where should i turn ?
should i pray to god or to christ ?
who can tell me where to direct my plea &apos; ?
i &apos;m a poor , miserable sinner , and i beseech the lord of life and death !
i &apos;m not worthy . i &apos;ve broken your every commandment .
condemn me to eternal darkness !
let nothing remain of me !
do what you will to me , my lord , but spare the three of them !
&quot; david , i see that i no longer need grieve for you !
&quot; captive , return to thy prison !
she didn &apos;t do it yet !
i made it in time ! ”
sister edit is dead . i was at her side .
i promised her i &apos;d become a good husband and father .
you &apos;re lying !
sister maria told me you refused to go to her !
are you owing , david &apos; ? ”
no one believes i want to reform .
i want to be good , but no one believes me .
is it any wonder i cry &apos; ?
it &apos;s hard to believe , david .
but i do believe you .
your tears have convinced me .
i can &apos;t help crying too .
i won &apos;t be truly happy until all my sorrow is drained .
lord , please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped . ”
i can die peacefully because i seen a great love .
in the masters &apos; house .
tell mr. michael to bring my algerian sketches to me .
i would like to speak with mr. zoret
the butler .
the princess .
switt , the journalist .
claude zoret , the master .
&quot; already i have been offered 30000 dollars for these sketches , but i could not bring myself , to let go of them . &quot;
we are not going thus to sell our most beautiful memories .
please , tell mr. zoret , i will return again before the beginning of the opera .
so , one of these russian princesses whom at all costs love to be painted by the master .
have they for instance a monopoly on being painted by the master ?
how come you were made a model by the master , and almost his son ?
it was four years ago ...
these sketches are not worth anything
come back when you have learned to see correctly .
i would like to paint to you !
would you model for me ?
you owe much to him , michael ! but the master also must thank you !
his glory was born on the paintings in which you modelled .
at table , the conversation turns to death .
it is strange how , sometimes i fear dying so much that i do not know like thinking of it .
i do not fear death because prediction must be fulfilled
i cannot imagine a more beautiful end than to die for being adored
for me , death is simply the last stage of life
you know that your conversation has inspired in me a new picture ?
i want to paint caesar assassinated by brutus , his adoptive son .
and who will look like brutus ?
switt takes notes from our table conversation for the work that he is writing on the master
what is your prediction , duke , of what was spoken at table ?
that the last monthieu will know a great happiness
... and will pay with his life
the butler announces to them that the carriage is leaving
i regret much , i never paint pictures to order
but since there is time
michael , the spotlight !
the finances of the princess must be rather disordered
possibly she hopes to increase her credit by being painted by the master .
there we are !
i can come in the morning for the first pose ?
the &quot; winner &quot; is my best picture ,
i give it to you
there will come a day when all will belong to you
never had a picture given as much pain to master as the picture of princess zamikow
you have been up three nights without sleeping !
is that sensible ?
when i am alone , i see it in front of me , it goes well
but when she is seated here , everything vanishes
where is michael ?
he goes every afternoon to the opera to ogle a young ballerina .
go now , i want to work
i will return after food
you are the culprit of my sleepless nights , princess
serve the food , we will eat !
we do not wait for michael ?
today , we will drink in english glasses
the gentleman and the lady are already seated at table
you have sat down to eat without me ?
never have i been treated thus before
it is your eyes i cannot render them
it looks right ?
yes , now , those are her eyes !
only the youth can guess that
it was michael who painted them
how did you knew my eyes so well ?
where have you been throughout this time ?
i was in the country .
unfortunately i must leave
i go to the theater this evening .
you are the only one that does not suspect to anything
with regard to michael and zamikow
tell the butler to take the english glasses to my apartment the master gave permission
take away the board ,
mr. michael has gone out .
close the window
on this evening , the ballet danced tchaikovski &apos;s &quot; swan lake &quot;
you do not feel , do not see what i suffer ?
have pity on me , my friend ...
do you desire to have supper with us after the performance , mr. switt ?
go now , we meet soon
i want only to believe that the eternity exists .
the visits of michael to the master were made more and more rarely only dictated by the last conscience of having to
the thing itself is just a triviality
he came to request lately to me
youth wants to live totally and youth costs money
book this sum to my account !
from now on you will have your own account with my banker .
and then you will be able to begin a new page
now leave me alone , michael
&quot; we could see in its last work a picture of princess z. no brush stroke truer only the eyes make an exception .
the effect is so unrealistic that we would swear that the eyes have been painted by another hand &quot;
who knows the story of the eyes of the zamikow ?
yes , and he ?
perhaps that to somebody he says the truth and the truth to you , is ...
that you hated him from first day
because he broke into my life , where you wanted to be the only one that played a role
nobody knows when i am unique
nobody has the right to increase to my solitude
claude zoret , i request to you ... that you save the bitterer deceptions .
let go of the boy
no , charles , i do not want to die without my boy .
why you spoke to me never of this ?
call mercier , the art dealer that passes immediately
calm yourself , my darling
everything is going to fix itself , i found a solution .
leave michael &apos;s place setting
where is michael ?
painting in the country .
and alice ?
how is she ?
she is well , thanks
mr. leblanc , art dealer
i requested that you came , mr. leblanc , because i would like through you to sell my &quot; caesar and brutus &quot;
that is gorgeous , but ...
how to say , i mean ...
an atmosphere can be cool , not true ?
and atmosphere can be warm
so in this situation
another one of your canvases is on the market ... the &quot; conqueror &quot; ...
i want to rescue the &quot; conqueror &quot; under a pseudonym
the price little concerns me
put the picture in the appartment of michael , that is its place .
as of that day , claude zoret closed the door to everybody to create his masterpiece completely alone and when this was finished ,
michael returned .
bring wine !
for the sky , i have been inspired by the algerian sketches
today , for the celebration of return of michael , we will drink in english glasses
i have borrowed them
i have enough of you pretending
i have enough of being your model , the instrument of your glory
i want finally to be a free man , not to depend anymore on your good thanks
princess zamikow asks for mr. michael to the telephone .
i will never respond to you to what you &apos;ve just said to me , michael .
the homecoming ....
why you do not say anything ? speak then
what could i say , that does not make you suffer ?
finally came the day in which the master exposed his work .
the duchess , widow of monthieu wilhelmine sandrock
pardon my preoccupation , mr. zoret :
have you seen my son ?
that is a man who has lost all
my girl , pardon this question of a tormented mother :
do you know where is my son ?
tell alice that the last monthieu has paid for his happiness
the painter of the pain ...
the glory of the nation ...
where is michael ?
soon calm reigned again in the mansion of the master .
i am sorry i could not come ,
i have brought the criticism with me
i can read it for you ?
not now .
i have brought the criticism with me
i can read it for you ?
all write about the sky of your work is the most wonderful thing that you have ever painted
now , we propose to you 60000 dollars for the sketches
to the fact , where are your algerian sketches ?
i would much like to see them again
but mr. michael has just left .. with a large folder of drawings
possibly he has ...
is true nevertheless , i had forgotten ...
that i gave the sketches to him
yes , charles , now i am tired
i want to sleep now , to sleep ...
but in the course at night , the fate of the master is fulfilled .
the master is dying . switt .
take this as fast as is possible to mr. michael
i , claude zoret , that knows the solitude in this world , i will my last dispositions here
all my goods must go to my adoptive son , eugène michael .
have you found michael ?
is he coming soon ?
mr. michael will not be spoken to
i want to rest in the middle of a field
where germinate the seeds and grows the grass , and nobody will have to know the place where i am buried ,
swear that for me ?
jules , my friend , do not cry more .
i go where my heart will know rest
why you smile , claude ?
charles , now i can die peacefully. because i knew a great love
mr. michael , the master has died !
be quiet , be still ... i am with you .
the clgarette glrl of mosselprom
this film was made in 1924 in moscow by mejrabpom-rus studios
it is interesting because it &apos;s one of the first comedies dedicated to daily life in the ussr
the american macbright , who is interested in soviet russia is en route for moscow ...
maria ivanovna rybtsova ( a. dmokhovskaia ) .
nikodim mityushin ( igor llinski ) .
don &apos;t torture me !
the assistant book keeper who awaits the judgement of destiny .
i &apos;m not a man of the old régime , however i don &apos;t hesitate to use the traditional style .
without wishing to be poetic ,
i must tell you that i harbour for you the most sincere feelings and that my salary is that of a worker on the twelfth level .
yours , waiting , for the judgement of destiny , the accountant nikodim mityushin .
time is precious for those who are busy .
oliver macbright ( m. tsibulski ) .
cameraman latugin ( nikolai tsereteli ) .
the director barsov-aragonski ( a. baratov ) is always in edge before filming .
waiting for a more suitable means of transport .
how kind of you to have waited for me .
zina vessenina ( julia solntseva )
excuse me , i &apos;ll be back in a moment .
in love with the pretty cigarette girl
mityushin buys her goods from her , each day .
when you &apos;ve quite finished daydreaming , what about working the camera .
mityushin carefully treasures all the cigarettes that he &apos;s bought .
i forgot that you smoke .
no , you see ...
i mean to say , yes ...
i only buy mosselprom .
on the way from mosselprom to riga .
how long i &apos;ve waited for this wonderful moment .
latugin goes to the film lab .
to quickly develop the negative .
and so closes the day on which begins the adventures of our heros .
your rushes are ready .
the studio head discusses a new script .
look at that face .
why don &apos;t you give her a screen test ?
yes , you &apos;re right .
mityushin decides to use every means possible .
would you like to be in the movies ?
at the studio , filming was underway .
equally &quot; interested &quot; in the movies ,
macbright arrives at the studio .
what a pleasure it is to see you again !
here &apos;s the change from your american bank note .
having obtained a part ,
zina immediately sets to work .
it &apos;s no good , i can &apos;t get it right .
let me help you .
let &apos;s look at the scene together .
mityushin can &apos;t wait for his day &apos;s work to come to an end .
in half an hour ,
zina was so confident in her abilities that ...
i &apos;m leaving : i &apos;m going to become an actress .
there was something medieval , chivalrous and classical in the stubborness of mityushin .
can you help me ... you see there &apos;s usually a pretty brunette here , who sells cigarettes .
the weather isn &apos;t always on the side of those in love .
even at work , there are moments of idleness .
a man in two minds .
congratulate us , we &apos;re engaged .
i didn &apos;t want you cast in the first place ...
i told you i didn &apos;t have any talent ...
it &apos;s all over .
idiot , it &apos;s just a trick for the camera .
now you &apos;ve gone and spoilt the filming .
i don &apos;t want any reward : in saving you , i saved my love .
excuse me ... but why aren &apos;t you wet ?
could you show me your profile please .
you &apos;d be a sensation on the big screen , and i hope we &apos;ll see one another soon .
i don &apos;t smoke .
they haven &apos;t even been opened ...
to oliver macbright , due russian english agreements .
the interest life soviet russia constantly growing .
order promptly russian films .
from her ...
i must ask you to leave and not disturb our work .
don &apos;t talk to me in that tone of voice .
i can &apos;t work with latugin anymore .
give me another cameraman .
i &apos;m going to give you another job .
we &apos;ve been asked to make a film on the daily life of the new moscow .
they &apos;ve taken me off the film .
mister macbright thinks that with your face and your figure , you could easily earn a fortune .
the forgotten flower
7 acts 17 acts
latugin busies himself in his new job .
do you think you could give me the allure of a poet .
you know , it &apos;s terribly difficult to reconcile the creative abilities of the writer with the trivialities of the balance sheet .
this damn scene . if i could only rehearse it .
down on your knees , wretch !
i am merciless .
you can consider yourself free from all your obligations to us .
latugin hurries to finish his film .
this bit isn &apos;t necessary , you can take it out .
huh , he &apos;s jumbled everything up and then left .
good lord , what gibberish .
head of studios
the forgotten flower
a filmic tragedy in 17 acts
dedicated to a very talented young actress :
today brings the screening of the film commissioned by macbright .
please , could you hire this man :
he speaks english .
mister macbright repeats again that with your face and your figure , you could easily earn a fortune .
daily life in the new moscow by a. latugin .
the &quot; busy &quot; streets of moscow .
the care shown to children .
summer , moscow covered in flowers .
moscow &apos;s picturesque surroundings .
the new monuments :
the statue of dostoevsky .
they &apos;re making fun of us .
instead of showing us everyday life in the new moscow , they &apos;re showing us this woman. that the cameraman latugin has fallen in love with .
but it &apos;s a special genre : the travelogue .
this won &apos;t do .
you &apos;re both fired .
it &apos;s all your fault ...
dear mr. macbright , after thinking over your offer ,
i have come to the conclusion that for a poor , young woman like myself , scrupules are a luxury .
zina vessenina .
the work of macbright &apos;s new secretary consists of translating his correspondance .
dear mr. macbright , after thinking over your offer ,
i have come to the conclusion that : for a poor , young woman like myself , scrupules are a luxury .
zina vessenina .
please will you forgive me .
the cause of all this is my love for you .
can you really blame me ?
what a disgusting hypocrite !
and she &apos;s written to the american for an interview .
get away from me you venal creature ...
dear mr. macbright , after thinking over your offer ,
i have come to the conclusion that : for a poor , young woman like myself , scrupules are a luxury .
zina vessenina .
i can explain everything .
life &apos;s long road continues on its way .
if one &apos;s not working in the movies , being a street photographer isn &apos;t such a bad way of life
keep still .
mister macbright suggests that you forget you &apos;re an actress , and asks you not to make a scene .
office of oliver macbright : appartment nº3
they &apos;ve killed zina !
they &apos;ve just taken the trunk to the station .
open that trunk . there &apos;s a body inside .
it wasn &apos;t worth the bother of bringing all those mannequins ,
moscow has its own models .
they &apos;ve taken the trunk .
a fine detective , you &apos;d make .
how could you even think that the representative of a foreign prêt-à-porter company would want to kill his own models ?
you &apos;ve ruined my whole life , you and your imbecilic love .
tell mr. macbright that i don &apos;t wish to work for him any more .
my life is in tatters !
why are you so heartless . do you want to spoil everything about our love ?
you probably don &apos;t love me , or even know what love is !
why did you seduce me ?
why , force me to love you ?
you probably don &apos;t know how much it hurts , my broken heart .
mr. mityushin , i require you to do me a great service .
i would be extremely grateful if you would present yourself immediately at my residence .
oliver macbright .
i need your skills as a translator in a rather delicate matter . it is of very great importance for me
you will receive 100 dollars , and if everything goes according to plan , 1,000 more .
the important but delicate concern of oliver macbright ...
please , could you tell miss zina that i am asking for her hand in marriage .
i am flattered , but i &apos;m not ready for marriage .
oh , joy of joys .
she refused him .
tell her that what i shall treasure most on my long journey home are the fondest memories of her .
d &apos;you know what he said ?
&quot; it &apos;s her who seduced me because she was only after my money , and i &apos;ve seen through her little game &quot; .
any mail for mr. macbright should be forwarded to :
26 avenue 143 new york
you &apos;ll have to come with me .
jumping out of tram windows isn &apos;t allowed .
comrade , where do we get married round here ?

we bear gifts and viands to feast the suitors who , on the tomorrow , ... come to woo our princess .
tonight - with the magic rope .
beasts and scimitars guard the palace .
when night reaches its noon ...
the princess sleeps .
the treasure-where is it ?
the melody of the oriental night dies in the dawn .
and it is morning- .
it is the birthday of our princess ... and royal suitors come from all the east to seek her hand in marriage .
on the balcony of the princess , a slave girl reads a fortune-
the sands of mecca shape a rose .
this is the meaning : thou wilt wed the suitor who first toucheth the rose-tree in thy garden .
nizzy noodle !
he &apos;s turned love-bird .
she is a rare jewel , my love-bird .
something beyond your reach , you prince of thieves .
yet- once upon a time- a princesa was stolen from a palace ... under the very eye of harun-al-rashid .
they found a way into the palace and , with a subtle drug , they ... ... drowsed her and carrier her away .
the suitors are at the palace gates .
the prince of the indies whose palace is covered with an hundred thousand rubies .
he glowers .
i like him not - with all his rubies .
allah grant he touch not the rose-tree .
he touched not the rose-tree .
in the bazaars of the sleepy merchants , thy nimble fingers can ... ... procure us princely raiment .
the prince of persia whose fathers fought at feyjoo ... ... five hundred years ago .
he &apos;s fat and gross as if he fed on lard .
praise allah !
he touched not the rose-tree .
the bazaars of the merchants ...
cham shang the great , prince of mongols , king of ho sho ... ... governor of wah hoo and the island of wak .
bagdad is a mighty city .
fail i to win the princess , it shall be mine by strategy .
o horrible !
he chills my blood with fear !
ahmed , prince of the isles , of the seas , and of the seven palaces .
ahmed , prince of the isles , of the seas , and of the seven palaces .
see how he rides - a prince indeed !
&apos;this he would make me happy .
allah guide him to touch the rose .
ahmed , prince of the isles , of the seas , and of the seven palaces .
there &apos;s no such rank nor title .
celestial majesty , the superstition of the princess ... ... centers on that rose-tree .
how tragic , o prince , if you had been killed ... ... and an end put to your illustrious family .
we must make haste to steal her .
prince of the isles and the seas .
allah foretold thee with a rose .
we must away from here .
the caliph awaits the suitors .
to possess bagdad i have now a two-fold reason .
in the throne room ....
the prince of the indies ...
the prince of persia .
the prince of the mongols ...
the just one , the holy , the high-born ... the caliph of bagdad .
the princess , according to ancient custom of our house ... ... hath made her choice .
let her ring be placed upon the hand of the chosen .
he has not wed her yet .
my daughter &apos;s choice and heir to the throne of bagdad .
the word is said . if any have protest , voice it now .
when the moon tips the cypress ... ... the betrothal will be consummate in feast . come .
he is the thief who yesternight did rob the palace .
desecration most foul , o mighty caliph , hath been wrought upon thy noble house !
this ahmed is but a common thief .
this ahmed who calls himself a prince , hunt him down !
i am not a prince .
i am less than the slave who serves you .. a wretched outcast ... a thief .
what i wanted , i took .
i wanted you ... i tried to take you ...
but , when i held you in my arms ... the very world did change .
the evil in me died .
i can bear a thousand tortures , endure a thousand deaths ... but not thy tears .
this arab prince is but a thief .
quick ! hide thyself .
if thou art found with me , they will be merciless .
i love you .
what torments can we devise for thee !
flog him !
fling him to the ape ! let him be torn to pieces .
a pearl to every guard .
she shall choose again .
the secret panel into the streets ...
choose ! i command you .
i myself will make the choice .
betray not the sands of mecca . gain time . defer the outcome .
send them to distant lands to seek some rare treasure .
at the seventh moon let them return .
when marriage plans have gone amiss , the seventh moon betokens bliss .
come , if you still wouldst steal her .
i have found a way through the tunnels of the tigers .
the princes will return at the seventh moon bearing treasure .
the one who brings the rarest wins the princess .
lose not thy hope , the rose persists , and something good will come of this .
turned lily-white he now goes mewling to the mosque .
thou art wounded .
in heart and soul .
i love a princess .
make thyself a prince .
allah hath made thy soul to yearn for happiness ... ... but thou must earn it .
stay you in bagdad .
i will send soldiers under guise of porters bearing gifts .
build me an army within the walls .
and so .. on the bedrock of humility thou canst build any structure .
come with me and i will set thy feet ... ... on the path that leads to treasure beyond thy dreams .
three suitors leave thy city gate ... ... but four are numbered in her fate .
at the end of the way is a silver chest ... ... that doth contain the greatest magic . thou must be brave .
go now . control thy destiny .
give this to her who hath already my heart .
a day &apos;s journey from bagdad ... a caravansary in the desert ...
thus far the three princes have traveled in company .
great lords of asia , good fortune to you ... ... second only to mine own !
let us meet here at the end of the sixth moon .
set spies to follow each .
a defile in the mountains of dread adventure ...
the hermit of the defile .
i seek a magic chest that lies beyond this defile .
knowest thou , rash youth ... devouring flames , ... foul monsters , shapes of death beset the path ?
a hundred years have i been here .
many have gone this way and none returned .
but , if thy resolve be firm , i will help thee .
if thou dost reach the cavern of enchanted trees ... ... touch with this talisman the midmost tree .
in bagdad , the pavilion of the princess ...
he too may return by the seventh moon .
... but his road is hard .
you must pray for him .
the first moon .
the valley of fire ...
the second moon .
in search of rare treasure , the persian prince came to the bazaars of shiraz .
a crippled beggar knew a priceless secret .
the magic carpet .
they know not its value .
my prince , here is the greatest rarity in the world , ... the flying carpet .
the third moon .
the valley of the monsters .
the cavern of the enchanted trees .
thou hast shown great courage ... ... but thy way is yet hard .
this is the chart to guide thee to the old man of the midnight sea .
the fourth moon .
in search of rare treasure , the prince of the indies ... ... came to a forgotten idol near kandahar .
this is the greatest rarity in the world , the magic crystal .
the fifth moon .
the old man of the midnight sea .
at the bottom of the sea is an iron-bound box .
now you must climb to the abode of the winged horse .
that star-shaped key will give you entrance here .
the abode of the winged horse ...
the sixth moon .
in search of rare treasure , the prince of the mongols ... ... came to the island of wak .
a court magician knew a secret shrine .
the magic apple ...
that fisherman .
far rarer than india &apos;s crystal or persia &apos;s carpet .
thou wilt haste to bagdad and , at the end of this sixth moon , give order that the prince be poisoned .
the citadel of the moon ...
the magic chest is wrapped in a cloak of invisibility .
the cloak of invisibility and the magic chest ...
at the end of the sixth moon ...
a day &apos;s journey from bagdad .. again the caravansary in the desert .
let us haste to bagdad .
o prince of the indies , discover this with the crystal . ... does the princess wait as she pledged ?
spread the flying carpet .
with the magic apple we shall save her life .
the learned doctor , zakariya of kufa .
i was at the portals of death and now i glow with health . ... what miracle is this ?
i was i who brought you back .
by the beard of the prophet , it is rarest .
her life belongs to me .
¡ to me ! to me !
it is for me to decide which gift is rarest .
a moment , o princes !
without the carpet you could not have come . ... without the apple you could not have cured me . apple .. crystal .. carpet .
bagdad is in the hands of the mongols .
open wide the gates of bagdad !
